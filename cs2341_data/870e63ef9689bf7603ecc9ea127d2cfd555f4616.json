Pulmonary opacities are usually evident on the radiograph within 12 h of the onset of symptoms [3] . Although the imaging findings do not allow a specific etiologic diagnosis, CAP diagnosis and disease management most frequently involve chest radiography, and other imaging modalities are not usually required [4] . The spectrum of causative organisms of CAP includes gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila and viral agents such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial viruses [5] . However, many community-acquired pneumonias are still commonly caused by S. pneumoniae and are lobar in appearance.",
