            "text": "The outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause that first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has recently been assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. The pneumonia is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), and the disease it caused was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. As of March 12, 2020, a total of 80 981 cases had been reported in China, including 3173 reported deaths. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed patients continues to grow outside of China, and 45 309 cases have already been reported [1] . The relatively high infectivity, rapid progression of lung involvement, and lack of definite effective treatment make it urgent to develop efficient measures of management based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although many empirical therapeutic options have been introduced on several operational recommendations, including existing and new generation of antivirals, steroids, and traditional Chinese medicine, the optimal strategy for severe COVID-19 remains unclear.",

Clinical features of those with pneumonia include fever and cough, and in many cases a sudden and accelerating respiratory distress originated from interstitial pneumonia. In those who rapidly progressed to critical conditions, reduced peripheral lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory factors were observed, indicating an overwhelming immune response [3, 4] . Previous experiences with SARS showed that the main pathogenesis of organ dysfunction lay in the overall cytokine dysregulation. Similarly, the point when status deterioration starts in patients with COVID-19 should be a critical window of opportunity for intervention. Here we report on 3 patients with COVID-19 who received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) at the time of initiation of respiratory distress, with satisfactory clinical and radiographic recovery.",

Nevertheless, no definite treatment has been identified, which makes clinical management extremely difficult. Here we report a case series of patients with COVID-19, all of whom were successfully treated by high-dose IVIg at the early stage of clinical deterioration. Based on these observations, a high dose of IVIg administered at the appropriate point could successfully block the progression of the disease cascade and improve the outcome of COVID-19. The natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not resemble that of any of the previously known coronaviruses. To date, we have noticed quite a wide clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and pulmonary infiltrations. A large proportion of reported symptomatic cases, including our patients and many others, followed a similar track of progression. The infection often started with mild or moderate unspecific symptoms, including but not limited to low-grade fever, sore throat, coughing, fatigue, and malaise, similar to the symptoms of a common cold. The initial symptoms would abate or persist for around 3-7 days, when high-grade fever developed and respiratory distress became quite prominent. Some of these patients would also have gastrointestinal symptoms during this period. However, if we look at the CT series shown here, which were quite typical of most COVID-19 patients, we would have a very strong impression that most of the lesions started from the periphery, especially the subpleural region when acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed [5] . These features indicated a hematogenous or lymphatic distribution or spreading of pathogenic factors rather than direct inspiration.",

The third phase is the final recovery phase. This was demonstrated by not only the clinical features but also the laboratory dynamics, including progressive lymphocytopenia and elevated inflammation markers at the time of acceleration. Therefore, strategies against COVID-19 should also be specified according to the course of infection. The best timing of antivirals, if any are used, may lie in the phase before acceleration. When clinical deterioration begins, the first few days of deterioration may present a critical point when potent suppression of the inflammatory cascade could save the patients from fatal immune-mediated injuries, as shown here. Moreover, from the experiences of our patients, if the acceleration of the disease could be stopped, it seemed to work well even if no effective antiviral drugs were given.",

The dose of IVIg was determined based on well-established practice in immune modulation therapy for other diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, etc. [6, 7] , with a consideration of potential cardiac or renal impairment in severe COVID-19 patients. None of the 3 patients reported any adverse events. All patients were clinically improved shortly after the administration, with their temperature back to normal in 1-2 days and breathing difficulties alleviating in 3-5 days. Confounding factors did exist, including the use of different antivirals in 2 of the 3 patients at various time points and a short course of steroids in patient 3. Moreover, in patient 2, valsartan, an angiotensin receptor 1 blocker (AT1R), had been used for treating hypertension. As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the major receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9] , there has been a hypothesis that higher expression of ACE2 after being chronically medicated with AT1R may protect SARS-CoV-2-infected patients against acute lung injury rather than putting them at higher risk, though this currently remains unproven [10] . Nevertheless, from the timeline and patterns of disease course in these 3 patients, it is most probable that high-dose IVIg played the leading role in their recovery.",

In previous studies of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), IVIg therapy has exhibited various clinical benefits with good tolerance [15] [16] [17] .
