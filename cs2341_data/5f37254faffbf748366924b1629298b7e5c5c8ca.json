Despite attempts to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease through management practices and vaccination programs, little progress has been made to lower the in- ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is an economically important disease of feedlot cattle that is caused by viral and bacterial pathogen members of the BRD complex. Many cases of subclinical BRD go untreated and are not detected until slaughter, when lung lesions are identified. The objectives of this study were to identify which BRD pathogens were associated with the presence of lung lesions at harvest and to identify genomic loci that were associated with susceptibility to lung lesions as defined by consolidation of the lung and/or the presence of fibrin tissue. Steers from a Colorado feedlot (n = 920) were tested for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens using deep pharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs collected on entry into the study. Pathogen profiles were compared between cattle with or without lung consolidation (LC), fibrin tissue in the lung (FT), a combination of LC and FT in the same lung (lung lesions [LL]), and hyperinflated lungs (HIF) at harvest. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip. Genomewide association analyses (GWAA) were conducted using EMMAX (efficient mixed-model association eXpedited), and pseudoheritabilities were estimated. The pathogen profile comparisons revealed that LC (P = 0.01, odds ratio [OR] = 3.37) and LL cattle (P = 0.04, OR = 4.58) were more likely to be infected with bovine herpes virus-1 and that HIF cattle were more likely to be infected with Mycoplasma spp. (P = 0.04, OR = 4.33). Pseudoheritability estimates were 0.25 for LC, 0.00 for FT, 0.28 for LL, and 0.13 for HIF. Because pseudoheritability for FT was estimated to be 0, GWAA results for FT were not reported. There were 4 QTL that were moderately associated (P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) with only LC, 2 that were associated with only LL, and 1 that was associated with LC and LL. Loci associated with HIF included 12 that were moderately associated and 3 that were strongly associated (uncorrected P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). A 24-kb region surrounding significant lead SNP was investigated to identify positional candidate genes. Many positional candidate genes underlying or flanking the detected QTL have been associated with signal transduction, cell adhesion, or gap junctions, which have functional relevance to the maintenance of lung health. The identification of pathogens and QTL associated with the presence of lung abnormalities in cattle exhibiting subclinical BRD allows the identification of loci that may not be detected through manifestation of clinical disease alone. cidence of disease (USDA, 2005) . In U.S. feedlot cattle, the prevalence of clinical BRD has been shown to vary between 5 and 44% across a 15-yr period (Snowder et al., 2005) . This variability is potentially due to environmental factors such as stocking density and climate (Snowder et al., 2005) . Unlike clinical BRD, the prevalence of subclinical BRD has not been well documented. However, it has been suggested that subclinical BRD infection is common, primarily because the correlation of lung lesions in harvested cattle with cattle diagnosed with BRD is low (Griffin, 2014) . Common findings at harvest include lung consolidation, in which the lung alveoli are filled with fluid or tissue, and the presence of interstitial fibrinous connective tissue that can lead to fibrosis. These lesions can significantly impact cattle performance in the feedlot by lowering ADG, carcass quality, and HCW (Bryant et al., 1999) . Previous studies have identified loci associated with severe lung lesions and have investigated the effects of lung lesions on growth and carcass traits, but the impact of pathogens on the prevalence of lung lesions at slaughter has not been fully explored (Keele et al., 2015) . The objectives of this study were to identify host loci associated with the presence of lung consolidation and lung lesions (consolidation and fibrin) and to evaluate the relationship between BRD pathogens and lung lesion prevalence in feedlot cattle.",

Briefly, on evisceration, lungs were manually palpated and evaluated for presence and severity of lung lesions, and any additional abnormalities (hyperinflated lungs, missing lung lobes, etc.) were noted. Lungs were independently scored based on the amount of lung consolidation (LC) present (0 = <5% consolidation, n = 512; 1 = 5-15% consolidation, n = 165; 2 = 15-50% consolidation, n = 167; and 3 = >50% consolidation, n = 76) and the presence and severity of fibrin tissue in the lung (FT; NFT = normal or no fibrin tissue, n = 436; M = minor amounts of fibrin, n = 186; and E = extensive fibrin in the lungs, n = 298). Animals that had both LC and FT damage to their lungs were given a combined lung lesion (LL) score reflecting the scores for both LC and FT (i.e., 1E). This resulted in a combined phenotype: 0NFT (n = 290), 0M (n = 101), 0E (n = 121), 1NFT (n = 62), 1M (n = 43), 1E (n = 60), 2NFT (n = 55), 2M (n = 34), 2E (n = 78), 3NFT (n = 29), 3M (n = 8), and 3E (n = 39).

A 2-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to determine if the OR was significant (P < 0.05) as previously described (Morris and Gardner, 1988) . The GWAA were performed using an efficient mixed-model association eXpedited with a genomic relationship matrix (EMMAX-GRM) additive genotypic model as part of the SNP and Variation Suite version 8 (SVS; Golden Helix, Inc., Bozeman, MT; http://goldenhelix.com). The general mixed model can be defined as yc = cX\u03b2 + cZuc + \u03f5, in which y is an nc \u00d7 c1 vector of the observed phenotypes, X is a nc \u00d7 cq incidence matrix relating observations to levels of fixed effects, \u03b2 is a qc \u00d7 c1 vector representing the levels of the fixed effects, and Z is a nc \u00d7 ct matrix relating the instances of the random effect to the observations. Residuals were estimated based on maximum likelihood parameters and are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (Kang et al., 2010) . In this study, we assumed that Var(u) = \u03c3 2 gK and Var(\u03f5) = \u03c3 2 e INF, such that Var(\u03b3) = \u03c3 2 g ZKZ\u2032 + \u03c3 2 e INF, in which K is the matrix of pairwise genomic relationships and Z is the identity matrix INF. Each GWAA included breed as a fixed effect. Using SVS, pseudoheritability estimates were calculated as h 2 = \u03c3 2 a /(\u03c3 2 a + \u03c3 2 e ) (Kang et al., 2010) . The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) thresholds for unadjusted P-values were used to determine if there was evidence of an association between the phenotype and each SNP.",

Eight of the 12 HIF positional candidate genes had SNP located with their introns, whereas 4 had SNP located in the surrounding intergenic regions. The pseudoheritability estimate for HIF was 0.13. Several of the positional candidate genes associated with LC, LL, and HIF function in signal transduction. Six of the 15 genes (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 2 [CREB3L2], inositol hexakisphosphate kinase [IP6K3], inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 3 [ITPR3], kinase insert domain receptor [KDR] , MAPKAP1, and NCALD) are involved in signal transduction pathways. The involvement of these genes in signal transduction pathways in cattle with BRD is consistent with pathways associated with respiratory disease in humans. Signal transduction pathways are known to have a role in the inflammatory response of respiratory cells of humans affected by bacterial infec-tions (Birukov et al., 2004) , and abnormalities in these pathways can lead to fibrotic disorders and excess inflammatory responses in the lung (Massagu\u00e9, 1998) . Mutations affecting signal transduction could trigger more adverse inflammatory reactions to infections, potentially leading to lung cell damage.",

Adherens junctions and tight junctions of the respiratory epithelium contribute to the barrier between harmful environmental stimuli and the lung in most animal species including humans (Harris and Tepass, 2010) . Several families of viruses use cell adhesion components of both adherens junctions and tight junctions, such as E-cadherin, to gain entry into the epithelium (Mateo et al., 2015) . In humans, infection with respiratory syncytial virus has been linked to decreased expression of E-cadherin (Wang et al., 2000) . In respiratory cells, decreased expression of E-cadherin can lead to cells breaking away from the basal membrane and contributing to LC. Six genes associated with HIF (IP6K3, ITPR3, KDR, tripartite motif containing 3 [TRIM3], TUBA1A, and TUBA1B) are in gap junction pathways. Gap junctions are composed of proteins known as connexins, which form channels on the cell surface to allow communication between connected cells and contribute to surfactant secretion in the lung. Multiple connexins are known to be differentially expressed in response to pulmonary inflammatory diseases in humans including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung inflammation (Freund-Michel et al., 2016) . Additionally, connexins can be regulated by both adherens junction-and tight junction-associated proteins, and it has been suggested that connexin 40 and connexen 43 are required to work with tight junctions in the lung and brain to maintain the endothelial barrier (Nagasawa et al., 2006) . Any mutation affecting respiratory cell adhesion or gap junctions could alter lung permeability, allowing pathogens to more easily invade the tissue.",

Failure to identify subclinical BRD in cattle is both an animal welfare issue and an economic issue. This study identified QTL associated with subclinical disease through the presence or absence of LC, LL, or HIF in cattle at harvest. There were no overlapping QTL between LC, LL, and HIF, but there was a single QTL on BTA14 that overlapped between LC and LL. Of the 646 (64.7%) cattle with lung abnormalities, only 319 (49.4%) had clinical signs of BRD. The remaining cattle were perceived as healthy, showing few clinical signs of disease. The proportion of the cattle with lung abnormalities was nearly as great in those that appeared to be healthy (69.0%) as in cattle treated for clinical BRD (71.5%). This illustrates the difficulty in accurately identifying cattle with subclinical BRD and the subsequent complexity of identifying QTL associated with enhanced resistance to the disease. This segment of the BRD-susceptible feedlot population has not been well investigated for the identification of QTL associated with the disease (Neibergs et al., 2014) . The identification of QTL associated with lung abnormalities can be included with QTL associated with clinical BRD to aid in the selection of cattle that are more resistant to both clinical and subclinical BRD. This will ultimately lower the prevalence of Table 2 .
