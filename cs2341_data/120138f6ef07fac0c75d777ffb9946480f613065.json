            "text": "Neuropathic pain is among the most debilitating forms of chronic pain. Studies have suggested that chronic pain pathogenesis involves neuroimmune interactions and blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We modeled neuropathic pain in rats by inducing chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and analyzed the effects on C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/CXCR3 activation, BSCB permeability, and immune cell migration from the circulation into the spinal cord. We detected CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons and observed that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 activation, BSCB disruption, and mechanical hyperalgesia. CCI-induced BSCB disruption enabled circulating T cells to migrate into the spinal parenchyma. Intrathecal administration of an anti-CXCL10 antibody not only attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia, but also reduced BSCB permeability, suggesting that CXCL10 acts as a key regulator of BSCB integrity. Moreover, T cell migration may play a critical role in the neuroimmune interactions involved in the pathogenesis of CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Our results highlight CXCL10 as a new potential drug target for the treatment of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that multiple proinflammatory mediators are released from injured nerve fibers and adjacent immune cells after nerve injury and that these mediators in turn promote central sensitization and behavioral hyperalgesia (5, 10) . Furthermore, animal studies have shown that peripheral nerve injury induces circulating immune cells to enter the spinal cord parenchyma, a phenomenon that may contribute to pain-related behaviors during the development of neuropathic pain (11) (12) (13) .",

We also determined that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling, increased BSCB permeability, and promoted T cell migration into the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, intrathecal administration of anti-CXCL10 antibodies attenuated the rats' behavioral hyperalgesia and reduced the CCI-induced increases in BSCB permeability and T cell infiltration into the dorsal horn. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to report that blocking CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling attenuates the increases in BSCB permeability and T cell infiltration of the spinal cord induced by peripheral nerve injury.",

Studies have shown that type 1 T helper cells secrete interferon gamma, and elevated spinal cord interferon gamma levels can induce CXCL10 secretion. CXCL10 in turn increases BSCB permeability and promotes the migration of T cells into the spinal cord (44, 49) . This creates a positive feedback system that favors ever-increasing migration of activated T cells into the spinal cord. This implies that blocking the contribution of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling to increased BSCB permeability, as we did by administering anti-CXCL10 antibodies to the CCI group rats, may disrupt this positive feedback loop.",
