            "text": "This paper presents a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand is subsided.",

Italy, which has 12,428 deaths, and Spain, which has 8,464, are the only two countries with higher death tolls. However, United States tops both of these countries in the current number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (189,035) [1] .

This is even faster than the increases observed in Spain and Italy at the same point in the course of their epidemics [2] . In Northern Italy, one of the global epicenters of the pandemic, COVID-19 has completely overwhelmed the healthcare system, forcing doctors into impossible decisions about which patients to save.

The modeling framework incorporates conditions under which part of the historically available ventilator inventory is used for non-COVID-19 patients, who also present themselves for treatment with the COVID-19 patients. Thus, only a fraction of the historical ventilator inventory is available to treat COVID-19 patients. The remaining demand needs are met by allocation and re-allocation of available ventilators from FEMA (a central agency) and availability of additional ventilators through planned productions. The availability of inventory from a state for re-allocation incorporates a certain risk-aversion parameter. We present results, while performing a what-if analysis, under realistically generated demand scenarios using available ventilator demand data and ventilator availability data for different US states. An online planning tool is also developed, and made available for use.",

The paper points out that poor availability of representative and high quality data, and a lack of collaboration between operations research scientists, healthcare practitioners, and stakeholders are found to be common challenges for effective operation research modeling in global health. A medical resource allocation problem in a situation caused by a disaster is considered in [30] , where victims' deteriorating health conditions are modeled as a Markov chain, and the resources are allocated to optimize the total expected health recovery rate and to reduce the total waiting time. Certain illustrative examples in a queuing network setting are also given in [30] . The problem of scarce medical resource allocation after a natural disaster using a discrete event simulation approach is investigated in [15] . Specifically, the authors in [15] investigate four resource-rationing principles: first come-first served, random, most serious first, and least serious first. It is found that without ethical concern, the least serious first principle exhibits the highest efficiency. However, a random selection provides a relatively fair allocation of services and provides a better trade-off with ethical considerations. Resource allocation in an emergency department in a multi-objective and simulation-optimization framewok is studied in [17] . Simulation and queueing models for bed allocation are studied in [28, 19] .",

However, the model in [21] does not consider distribution of ventilators over time.

The demand arising from different entities (states) peaks at different times, and it is important to meet as much of this demand as possible to save lives. Each participating entity is risk averse to sharing their excess inventory at any given time, and this risk-aversion is captured by using a safety threshold parameter. Specifically, the developed model is applicable for the current COVID-19 pandemic, where many US states are in dire need of mechanical ventilators to provide life-support to severely-and critically-ill patients. Computations were performed using realistic ventilator need forecasts and availability under a wide combination of parameter settings.",

However, if less than 25% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the current national stockpile and the anticipated production may not be sufficient under extreme demand scenarios. As expected, the magnitude of this shortfall increases when one considers more and more extreme demand scenarios.",

This include the process of demand forecast scenario generation, estimates of initial ventilator inventory, and future production quantities. Each one of these, as well as other model parameters, can be changed in the model input to obtain more refined results. Nevertheless, an important finding is that a state's willingness to share its idle inventory can help address overall shortfall.",
