(Diptera: Muscidae), were examined for their ability to harbor and transmit Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV) by using a mesogenic NDV strain. Laboratory-reared \u00dfies were experimentally exposed to NDV (Roakin strain) by allowing \u00dfies to imbibe an inoculum consisting of chicken embryo-propagated virus. NDV was detected in dissected crops and intestinal tissues from exposed \u00dfies for up to 96 and 24 h postexposure, respectively; no virus was detected in crops and intestines of sham-exposed \u00dfies. The potential of the house \u00dfy to directly transmit NDV to live chickens was examined by placing 14-d-old chickens in contact with NDV-exposed house \u00dfies 2 h after \u00dfies consumed NDV inoculum. NDVexposed house \u00dfies contained \u03f710 4 50% infectious doses (ID 50 ) per \u00dfy, but no transmission of NDV was observed in chickens placed in contact with exposed \u00dfies at densities as high as 25 \u00dfies per bird. Subsequent dose\u00d0response studies demonstrated that oral exposure, the most likely route for \u00dfy-tochicken transmission, required an NDV (Roakin) dose \u054610 6 ID 50 . These results indicate that house \u00dfies are capable of harboring NDV (Roakin) but that they are poor vectors of the virus because they carry an insuf\u00decient virus titer to cause infection.",

The nature of the international poultry industry facilitates the movement of poultry products, equipment, and people and the subsequent spread of disease. To monitor outbreaks and its potential spread, ND is included on the A-list of reportable diseases maintained by the Of\u00dece International Epizooties (OIE 2006) . In 2006, 15 countries reported active or resolved outbreaks of ND within their borders (OIE 2006) . Recently, \u03fe117,000 chickens were destroyed on commercial broiler farms in Romania as a result of this disease (OIE 2006) . In North America, ND was discovered in a California backyard chicken \u00dfock in fall 2002 (APHIS 2003) . Within 2 mo, the disease had spread to area commercial poultry operations. Subsequently, Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV) showed up in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. More \u03fe3 million birds were destroyed to keep the disease from spreading further with industry losses estimated at $5 billion (Anonymous 2003) .",

The highly contagious and fatal disease is spread through direct contact with infected birds, their feces, and secretions (Alexander 1991) .

Disease may be spread by exotic and feral birds, animals, poultry products, airborne, feed, water, and vaccines. Humans contribute significantly to the spread of ND, especially poultry workers, cleanout crews, rendering staff, feed delivery personnel, egg handlers, farmers, and vaccination crews (Alexander 1991) .",

The little house \u00dfy, Fannia canicularis (L.), was incriminated in the transmission of ND in the California outbreak (Rogoff et al. 1975) . Seven species of \u00dfies [Musca domestica L., F. canicularis, Fannia femoralis (Stein), Muscina stabulans (Fallen), Stomoxys calcitrans L., Ophyra (Hydrotaea) spp., and Phaenicia spp.] were captured on ND-positive farms. Collections were made \u03fd2 d and \u03fe2 d of depopulation. NDV was found in two pools of F. canicularis and one pool of F. femoralis (Rogoff et al. 1975) . Interestingly, house \u00dfy pools were negative for NDV in this study. F. canicularis was proven a vector of NDV in subsequent laboratory studies (Rogoff et al. 1977) . Unfortunately, the proposed evaluation of the house \u00dfy under similar laboratory conditions was never completed. The only report of the house \u00dfy being involved in the transmission of NDV was published in Russia (Milushev et al. 1977) . Under laboratory conditions, the house \u00dfy carried virus on the body and was capable of transmitting NDV virus up to 96 h.",

Adult house \u00dfies feed on semisolid and liquid diets, often in the form of manure and excreted bodily \u00dfuids. The adult \u00dfy, using sponging mouthparts, consumes these \u00dfuids that are stored temporally in the insect crop. The crop holds \u03f72.3 \u03ee 0.03 l of \u00dfuid (unpublished data). Generally, quantities of crop \u00dfuids are mixed with semisolid foods that pass into the insect midgut over 5 h for digestion (Hainsworth et al. 1990 ). The \u00dfy may use crop \u00dfuids to help liquefy food solids before ingestion and regurgitate crop contents onto foods and surfaces producing \"\u00dfy specks\" (West 1951) . Similarly, \u00dfies frequently defecate while feeding and resting on surfaces.

Live vaccines are usually developed from lentogenic and mesogenic strains and include Mukteswar (mesogenic), Roakin (mesogenic), and La Sota (lentogenic), among others (Alexander 1991) . Accordingly, lentogenic vaccines may be administered intranasally and mesogenic vaccines intramuscularly.

In controlled experiments, NDVexposed house \u00dfies did not transmit NDV even though each \u00dfy carried \u03f710 4 ID 50 of virus when placed in contact with susceptible chickens. This was unexpected, because NDV-exposed \u00dfies were eaten by contact chickens soon after placement in isolation units. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated a dose effect for NDV Roakin: an ID 50 \u054610 6 was required to infect chickens by the oral route, the likely route of transmission for NDV by \u00dfies. These studies indicate that at least for NDV Roakin, house \u00dfies did not carry suf\u00decient quantities of virus to infect chickens and are unlikely vectors. Additional studies using other NDV strains, particularly velogenic strains, are needed to de\u00denitively determine the role of house \u00dfies as vectors of NDV.",
