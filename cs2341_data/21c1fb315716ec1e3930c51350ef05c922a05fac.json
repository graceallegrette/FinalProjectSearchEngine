            "text": "Since the isolation of the novel coronavirus (CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1 multiple outbreaks of this virus have occurred inside and outside of the Kingdom, including reports of infection from at least 27 countries. 2 The MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in Riyadh in June 2015 and led to the closure of the Ministry of National Guards Health Affairs Hospital. 3 The outbreak affected many patients and health care workers, and required a systematic approach to successfully contain the outbreak and resume full organizational services. 3, 4 Patients with cancer are usually susceptible to infectious diseases, and it is known that infections are a leading cause of death among this patient population. There are multiple causes for this vulnerability of patients with cancer related mainly to 3 factors: the underlying disease, cancer-directed treatment, and underlying comorbidities. The underlying malignancy may result in a weakened immune system due to the negative effect on immune cells, affecting their quantity or quality, as is the case in leukemia or lymphoma. Cancer therapy itself, whether it is surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, disturbs the immune system in various ways and results in an increased risk of infection. Patients with cancer are likely to have other comorbidities, whether due to age or exposure to cancer risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and other lifestyle choices. Chronic diseases and comorbidities were identified previously as risk factors for MERS-CoV mortality. 5, 6 All these factors lead to the predisposition of patients with cancer to a high risk of acquiring infectious diseases with a worse outcome than patients without cancer. 7 In 2015, our oncology patients were affected by the MERS-CoV outbreak and, sadly, many of them died. The outcome of oncology patients affected by MERS-CoV infection was not reported independently from other chronic diseases. In this article, we describe the characteristics and outcome of all oncology patients infected with the virus at our institution during that outbreak.",
