These events raise an alarm on the route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Faced with the possibility of ocular transmission, ophthalmologists are very likely to contract the infection. Drawing on the rich experience during the previous SARS outbreak, the Chinese government has promptly released various protection measures for ophthalmology, and recommended protection for the eyes, as well as mouth and nose, when caring for patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recently published a similar recommendation for ophthalmologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on the latest published literatures, guidelines and clinical practice experience in domestic hospitals, we have summarized the Chinese experience through the lens of ophthalmology, hoping to make a contribution to protecting ophthalmologists and patients around the world, and praying that the pandemic will be contained as soon as possible.",

Shen and colleagues [3] performed a prospective case series study in 30 COVID-19 patients, finding SARS-CoV-2 in two conjunctival swabs of one patient. Another study by Chen et al. [1] demonstrated that out of 67 patients enrolled, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the conjunctival sac of three COVID-19 patients without ocular symptoms. Sun et al. found [2] that among 72 patients confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were found in ocular discharges belonging to one patient. The above studies confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can exist in tears or the conjunctival sac, but the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes remains uncertain.",

Their expression in the cells of ocular surface may be an access route of corona virus in eye, which provides clues to elucidating the pathogenesis of corona virus in the eyeballs. It is extremely important to disinfect ophthalmic examination instruments and protect ophthalmic medical care during the epidemic period to reduce crossinfection in clinical practice. Some suggestions against SARS-CoV-2 infection were offered in this article. Ophthalmic experts, from Society of Public Health Ophthalmology, Chinese Preventive Medicine Association and Beijing Ophthalmological Society and Youth Committee of Beijing Ophthalmological Society, provided suggestions on eye protection during the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. The delay of back-to-school time is an important measure to reduce cross infection on campus, and to protect the health of children and teenagers during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, remote teaching models has led to a dramatic shift in eye-use habits of children and adolescents. The potential effects on adolescent visual health cannot be ignored. Some suggestions of integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine are described to avoid the infection of ophthalmic medical practitioners and to effectively deal with novel coronavirus conjunctivitis during the diagnosis and treatment. This article briefly introduced the characteristics and identifications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and put forward suggestions and opinions from the aspects of personal protection of ophthalmologists, control managements of ophthalmic outpatient department and ward, cleaning and disinfection of ophthalmic equipment. prevention and control period of the epidemic of COVID-19, strict adherence to the prevention and control measures can effectively ensure the smooth implementation of the operation and the perioperative safety of medical staff and patients",
