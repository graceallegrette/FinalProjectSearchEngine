They may cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, or neurologic diseases with different levels of severity in a variety of hosts, including humans. Coronaviruses have positive-sense single-stranded RNAs, their genomic size are 26 to 32 kilobases, the largest for an RNA virus. And the viruses themselves appear crown-shaped under electron microscopy. Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronavirinae is further divided into four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus, based on their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures [3] .",

However, coronaviruses related to human SARS-CoV were found in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) in 2005, pointing to a bat origin of SARS-CoV [6] . This virus was named as SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Later, scientists reported two bat SARSr-CoVs could bind to both human and civet ACE2 receptors, suggesting that the Chinese horseshoe bats could serve as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoVs [7] . Additionally a five-year surveillance found highly diverse SARSr-CoVs in bats in one cave of Yunnan province, China, and these viral strains in this location contain all genetic building blocks needed to form a human SARS-CoV [8] , further supporting a direct bat origin for human SARS-CoVs.",

The 2019-nCoV has the most recent common ancestor with the neighboring bat coronaviruses, supporting the bat origin. The root of the coronavirus phylogeny was made up with other bat coronaviruses [13] , which is not surprising because bats are the natural reservoir for most viruses from Alphaand Betacoronavirus [3, 19] . However, the possibility remains that unidentified intermediate hosts are responsible for direct transmission of the virus to humans. Furthermore, there is clearly a genetic gap between the novel virus and the nearest bat viruses, (Fig. 1) i.e. 3.8% genomic difference, suggesting a missing link (i.e. other hosts) may exist, given the history of SARS and MERS.",

Same nonsynonymous changes were found in the S and ORF8 of a familial cluster case reported from Guangdong, i.e. L84S (Leu replaced by Ser at amino acid position 84) in three members and H49Y (His by Tyr) in two, indicating viral evolution may have occurred. However due to the limited sequence release and no functional changes given at present, adaptive evolution cannot be confirmed with these changes. Thus close monitoring of the virus's mutation, evolution, and adaptation is needed. Recombination of viruses occurs when two different parent viruses coinfect the same host cell and interact during replication, generating descendant viruses that have genes from both parental viruses. Recombination has often been associated with the expansion of the host range, increases in virulence, the evasion of host immune system and the evolution of resistance to antiviral treatments [21] . Both point mutations and recombination promote host shift for coronaviruses. For instance, there were frequent recombination events among bat SARSr-CoVs, by which progenitor of SARS-CoV could originate from [3, 22] .",

During the long time of co-existence of viruses and their hosts, host restriction was the dominant natural force keeping viruses circulating within the populations of the same species. However, occasionally, viruses recombine with each other in different hosts to generate new recombinants, with some of them having the potential to survive in new hosts such as humans via contacts. Recombination also occurs during circulation of different but similar viruses in human populations, also a natural process for viruses to increase genetic diversity.",

Next-generation sequencing is a highly efficient method for rapid identification of microorganisms and for surveillance of pathogens for infectious diseases [25] . Animal models and other laboratory tests would be needed to pinpoint the causative agents. The novel coronaviruses in Wuhan likely had a bat origin, but how the human-infecting viruses evolved from bats requires further study. The human-infecting virus may become more infectious but less virulent as it continues to (co-)evolve and adapt to human hosts. Since Wuhan is one of the largest inland transportation hubs in China and the city has been closed off, it is urgently necessary to step up molecular surveillance and restrict the movement of people in and out of the affected areas promptly, in addition to closing the seafood markets. To prevent human-tohuman transmission events, close monitoring of at-risk humans, including medical professionals in contact with infected patients, should also be enforced. Finally, virome projects [26] should be encouraged to help identify animal viral threats before viral spillover or becoming pandemics.",
