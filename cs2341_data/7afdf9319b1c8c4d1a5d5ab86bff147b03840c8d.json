That is, when there are no susceptible or infectious people, the outbreak is over. However, the fixed point at S 0 is stable, while the one at I 0 is unstable. For a disease in which infected people may become immune, a perturbation out of the state with nobody infected (I 0) leads eventually to the state with no susceptibles remaining (S 0). Deterministic compartmental models have stochastic cousins such as the Reed-Frost model (Abbey 1952) , which allow for the possibility of stochastic outbreak extinction. In stochastic models, the outbreak may reach the I 0 fixed point in finite time without completely exhausting susceptibles (S > 0). Infectious disease outbreaks are essentially chain reactions in which each infectious person turns susceptibles into infecteds. The rate at which new infections occur is determined by a dimensionless combination of model parameters known as the reproductive number, R. The reproductive number can be interpreted as the mean number of people who will be directly infected by a typical infectious person over the course of illness. When R > 1, disease prevalence increases exponentially. For example, in the S-I-R model, the equation for I can be rewritten as",

Usually, only a few of these factors are included explicitly in compartmental models, limiting their ability to represent mitigating interventions. In particular, social distancing aims to reduce \u03b2 by limiting the number of contacts between infectious and susceptible people in which transmission can occur.",

            "text": "It is important to distinguish between \"flattening\" the epidemic curve, i.e., reducing I at all times, and \"moving the curve to the right,\" i.e., delaying the peak of I. The impact of the epidemic can be substantially mitigated if the demand for health care resources does not outstrip the supply. In analogy with firefighting, flattening the curve accomplishes this by slowing the rate of burn as in a controlled burn. Delaying the peak works by temporarily extinguishing the flames, perhaps leaving the embers glowing. Both reduce the effective R, sometimes through the same measures, and the fire will re-ignite in both when those measures are lifted. The difference lies in the shape of the epidemic curve afterward. Controlling, but not extinguishing, the burn reduces S and hence the reproductive number when the fire re-ignites. The overall infection attack rate AR-the fraction of the population that eventually becomes infected-is typically a sigmoidal function of R that is not very sensitive to R as long as it is above 1. For example, in the S-I-R model, R 0 \u2212ln(1 \u2212 AR)/AR (Ball 1983) . Hence, flattening the curve does not significantly reduce the total number of people infected unless medical countermeasures can be developed during the delay it affords. In contrast, suppression works by driving infections to the (unstable) I 0 fixed point. The reproductive number when control measures are lifted in this case will be the same as before they were imposed. Suppression may reduce morbidity and mortality substantially, but only if it is global and simultaneous or continues long enough for pharmaceutical interventions to be developed. When illness severity depends on demographics, mitigation measures are most efficient when they are demographically targeted; suppression measures are most efficient when they are spatially and temporally targeted.",

Such models are well suited for representing demographically related heterogeneity in the course of illness or contact rates. The number of transition rates required to specify the model increases as the square of the number of partitions. At some point, depending on the modeler, it becomes natural to represent the model as a network of interacting partitions. Taken to the extreme, each host is in its own partition and the model is known as an individual-based model (Eubank 2004) .",

Modelers have generally been slow to adopt individualbased models because of these challenges; rather, they felt that capturing individual heterogeneities was unnecessary. However, driven by important heterogeneities in the risk of HIV infection and the targeting of interventions, network models and individualbased models of small populations started to become popular around the turn of the century (Morris and Kretzschmar 1997; Black and Singer 1987) . Individual-based models can represent not only biological, but also social heterogeneities, which are increasingly important aspects of pandemics. It is difficult to draw clear conclusions without such methods because individuals' circumstances, perceptions, deliberations, and social conventions are rather centrally causal. Even a single individual's behavior can carry out very important consequences. Hence, due to management of information and policies affecting individuals' responses, biologically similar diseases and circumstances can have different outcomes that will not be captured by aggregate models.",

The 9/11 attacks prompted then Vice President Cheney to propose vaccinating the entire population of the USA against smallpox. An NIH-sponsored forum held in 2001 concluded that models could be of great value in assessing the outcomes of Cheney's and other strategies to reduce the threat of a smallpox attack (Kaplan et al. 2002; Halloran et al. 2002; Ferguson et al. 2003; Eubank 2004; Gani and Leach 2001) .There was both optimism and skepticism about how, when, and whether modeling could be a useful tool for informing policy decisions.",

Moreover, the demographics of the illness, such as variations in the severity of illness, from asymptomatic to those requiring ventilator support, are almost unknown. \u2022 The organization of society is rapidly changing due to near-universal access to high-bandwidth telecommunications and social media, affecting both the ability to communicate how to implement social distancing correctly and the dissemination of false information.",

There is no doubt that sufficient social distancing can suppress an outbreak of a droplet-borne respiratory disease. However, there is also no doubt that society could not continue to function if everyone withdrew to the home for the several weeks necessary for complete suppression. Indeed, the very notion of a society assumes that personal survival does not depend solely on individual decisions.",

The authors consider a strategy which cycles between maximum and minimum social distancing. Their most important assumptions are about the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing the reproductive number, the rate of case ascertainment, and the amount of infection before detection. The Imperial team, as usual, has taken great care to calibrate parameters of the disease model. To be sure, calibration has been hampered by the lack of testing, especially our poor understanding of the prevalence of asymptomatic infection, but the Imperial College team makes reasonable assumptions. However, the model's reliance on a simplified picture of social interactions limits its extensibility to counterfactuals. The general nature of conclusions based on such a model can be expected to be similar to those of a simple compartmental model.",

They appear to have been influential in convincing policy-makers in the UK and the USA of the threat posed by COVID-19. They have stimulated discussion of novel mitigation strategies, although, once again, there is skepticism about the feasibility of on-again and off-again interventions. Such strategies not only depend on effective communication and adherence, but also on the premise of zero delay between sensing (e.g., ICU occupancy) and reacting (social distancing). The natural delay between imposing restrictions and seeing a drop in confirmed cases (as seen in Wuhan) will create social hysteresis loops. Also, it will be difficult for most officials to relax controls in the certain knowledge that many people will be infected.",

However, marshalling the available evidence into a scalable, customizable model that is easy for non-computer specialists to use and that addresses a wide range of questions about a variety of strategies remains a challenge.
