Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is usually associated with respiratory diseases of infants and young children, but RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) can cause significant morbidity and mortality in adults with predisposing conditions [1]. In recent studies, 16%-27% of hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) recipients initially diagnosed with RSV upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) had LRTI events [2-4]. Mortality rates of up to 60% are reported for RSV LRTI in HCT recipients but appear to be declining [3-7]; however, observed burden of RSV LRTI depends on diagnostic criteria. In cases",

Although some centers report using aerosolized or oral ribavirin to treat RSV LRTI in adult HCT recipients, efficacy has not been demonstrated in a randomized controlled clinical trial [10, 11] .

In contrast, presatovir treatment significantly reduced viral load, clinical signs, and symptoms of experimental RSV infection in healthy volunteers treated upon detection of RSV replication [16] .

However, clinical trials of presatovir conducted in multiple different patient populations, including this study and a companion URTI study (Chemaly et al [24] , this issue), indicate difficulties remain in translating challenge study results to successful clinical trials in patients with natural infection [25, 26] . One partial explanation is the challenge model's inconsistent representation of the natural infection setting. Challenge study volunteers were inoculated intranasally with RSV, then monitored for nasal RSV replication with twice-daily nasal washes that were immediately evaluated with molecular assays for RSV [16, 22, 23] . Antiviral treatment was initiated 6-24 hours after RSV detection, generally several days before peak viral load and prior to manifestation of significant clinical signs and symptoms [16, 22, 23] . In the present study, patients with naturally acquired RSV LRTI received presatovir later in the disease course compared with challenge study subjects (median [range], 5 days after symptom onset); delay was also observed in the URTI trial (median [range], 4 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] days) and other studies of presatovir in natural RSV infection [25, 26] . Because clinical signs and symptoms tend to correlate with nasal viral load [16, 22] , these patients presumably presented near or more likely after peak nasal viral load, potentially beyond the therapeutic window for presatovir even in immunocompromised patients. Host immune-mediated clearance of the virus at this stage may also mask treatment-induced reduction in viral load. Thus, treatment delay may explain lack of presatovir efficacy in the current study.",

Furthermore, lymphopenia is a major risk factor for RSV infection and subsequent poor outcomes in HCT recipients [2, 4, 29] , but only 4/47 patients with available data in the current study were lymphopenic (<200 cells/mm 3 ) at baseline, possibly because RSV infection occurred relatively late after HCT (median, 485 vs 129 days in the Waghmare study). These differences could be due to limited enrollment of patients perceived as fragile because of the requirement for lower respiratory sampling to confirm RSV LRTI.

The tendency of adults with naturally acquired RSV infection to seek treatment only after several days of symptoms, when the treatment window may have closed for fusion inhibitors in particular, is a challenge for clinical trials of RSV-specific antiviral therapies. The numerically lower rate of pulmonary complications in the presatovir URTI trial suggests that early treatment, before LRTI develops, is key for success in future studies.
