Thus, initial evaluation of this virus pathogenesis was likely to be subjective, and was the one of major factors that needed to be considered when conducting the risk assessment. Once more scientific evidence and knowledge becomes available after the end of this pandemic, overall review procedures and evaluation mechanisms need to be developed to improve and to minimize the limitations of the existing risk assessments by the Korea CDC.",

Communication of the risks also helps the preparation of protocols for laboratory-based testing development, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. It also helps the public prepare for enhanced surveillance, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, management of close contacts, case detection, and isolation. Communication of the risks also covers social distancing to deter further spreading by preventing public gatherings, and closure of schools and workplaces. It also covers prevention of nosocomial infection in healthcare facilities. Risk Assessment 1 and 2 are based on a situation with no reported cases in Korea and reporting of the disease outside Korea. The main public health measures are early detection of possible imported cases and isolation of the case to prevent further transmission in Korea.
