It has attracted worldwide attention, and for a long time, the news coverage was overwhelming. The news coverage made the general public feel dazed and even plunged into anxiety and panic. The use of instant-messaging technology and mobile phones makes the news spread faster and exacerbates the anxiety and panic of public. The psychological disorder caused by too many news coverage was named as 'headline stress disorder'. It 1 was first defined by psychologist Dr Steven Stosny as a high emotional response to endless reports from the news media, such as feeling anxiety and stress.",

A total of 1206 general public participated in the survey, including 478 males and 728 females. The results are listed in Table 1. From the results, we known that most of general public thought unofficial news about COVID-19 was too much and less reliable, and most of them suggested government to take some control of unofficial news coverage and release COVID-19 related information timely. Media organizations play an important role in the dissemination of news pertaining to public health crises, and media coverage has a direct or indirect impact on public behaviours. On the one hand, media publicity could increase public's knowledge and prevention tips about COVID-19. For example, our survey showed that 88.5% of residents thought that people should be restricted and stayed at home as possible during the current outbreak of COVID-19. On the other hand, exaggerated news reports would bring panic, stress and anxiety to public. In this survey, 42.4% participants thought public were too nervous and seeking for any possible way for prevent or treatment.
