Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9] . In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [3] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still ecient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low.",

The goal of this paper is to increase the capacity to identify asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 by applying group testing methods. Current practice typically involves a one-patient-one-test strategy. Recently the potential to detect COVID-19 RNA in a mixture of samples from individuals has been validated [9] using RT-PCR. The method was rst devised in 1943 during World War II to test large groups of US servicemen for syphillis prior to deployment [2] . Now, just as in the WWII era, large scale testing is necessary.",

The adaptive approach optimizes group size according to the prevalence. We provide an algorithmic specication for subdividing groups and account for the limited test accuracy and the possibility that the an individual's sample size constrains the number of tests.

Note that for prevalence of p = .1% a case at most 5 times in the population. In gure 11.2 where we perform the same experiment we nd cases that are tested up to 9 times. We apply GBS32 to nd at most D .99 (see Section ??) We see in gure 11.3 that the proportion of cases that are tested many times (more than 6) is very low. This is evidence that testing the cases indivually when we are running low (if we are limited to 6 uses) adds up to less than 1% extra tests. If we are able to test a sample more than this many times, individually testing when we are about to run out eects the eciency negligibly.",

For example at prevalence .001 and group sizes capped at 16, both DT16 and GSB16 are capable of outperforming Dorfman's method, that requires a group size of 33 for optimal performance.
