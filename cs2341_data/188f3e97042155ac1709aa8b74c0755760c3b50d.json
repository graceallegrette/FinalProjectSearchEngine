Corticosteroids were widely used during the SARS-CoV outbreak due to their known ability to modulate a variety of involved cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF\u03b1) [14, 16] . Various studies in humans noted that corticosteroids appeared effective in reducing immunopathological damage but concerns centred around the promotion of viral rebound and association with adverse events (including acute respiratory distress syndrome) [14] . One laboratory study which treated porcine respiratory coronavirus infected pigs with dexamethasone suggested that one or two doses of the corticosteroid in the acute phase of infection may effectively alleviate early pro-inflammatory response, but prolonged administration may play a role in enhancing viral replication [18] . A separate Chinese study, which separated SARS-CoV patients into 4 treatment groups, identified early high-dose steroids in combination with a quinolone as producing the best patient outcomes [19] . Nevertheless, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases such as Dengue as the 'glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition' [20] .",

Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1-Ra, IL-37 or IL-38 could potentially provide relief in both systemic inflammation and fever occurring after infection [24] . \u2022 Cytokine profiles in patients diagnosed with SARS showed marked elevation of T-helper lymphocyte type 1 (Th1) cytokine interferongamma (IFN-\u03b3), inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 for at least two weeks after disease onset. Children however presented a much milder cytokine and chemokine storm [16] . \u2022 The high levels of IL-6 in the acute stage associated with lung lesions found in SARS patients are activated by the viral nucleocapsid SARS-CoV N protein [25] . \u2022 Over induction of inflammatory cytokine and dysregulation of cytokine signalling has been observed in patients with SARS in comparison with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluAV), and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2). SARS-CoV and RSV induced high levels of IL-6 and RANTES compared with FluAV and hPIV2 [26] . \u2022 The N-protein of SARS-CoV induces pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury, which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by N-protein of SARS-CoV [15] . \u2022 SARS-CoV does not productively infect human macrophages (Mphi) or dentritic cells (DCs), however it modulates a massive release of IL-6 and IL-12 and compromises the endocytic capacity (e.g., antigen capture capture) of Mphi was significantly compromised [27] . \u2022 Changes in plasma T helper (Th) cell cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in 20 patients diagnosed with SARS were assessed. The elevation of Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 and chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 confirmed the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyper-innate inflammatory response in SARS through the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [17] .",

Report describes how indomethacin was unexpectedly found to possess potent antiviral activity against canine coronavirus (dramatically inhibit virus replication and protect the host cell from virus-induced damage). Activity also observed in vivo and against human SARS-CoV. Oral administration of concentration 1mg/kg found to be effective. [31] A study of pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by N-protein of SARS-CoV in rat models and effects of glucocorticoids on it been reported to be beneficial for treatment of the non-infectious idiopathic pneumonia syndrome which can follow stem-cell transplantation, a pulmonary syndrome that resembles SARS pneumonia in some respect. \u2022 If the SARS coronavirus does indeed lead to massive release of TNF-\u03b1f rom alveolar macrophages, then early inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 might be able to prevent TNF-\u03b1mediated immune activation and therefore reduce pulmonary injury in these patients. \u2022 Compared with the use of corticosteroids, the use of biologic TNF inhibitors, including etanercept, has the potential to be a more specific and more effective method of ameliorating the severe alveolar damage which can occur following infection with these agents. [37] Anti-TNF alpha therapy does not ameliorate disease in a model of acute virus-endotoxin mediated respiratory disease in pigs. COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbation induced by viral infection. The decreased production of IL-6 and IL-8 in cells pretreated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide, as well as the increased inhibitory effects of GFB observed in the present study, may be associated with the inhibitory effects of these drugs on COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbation. China 2020 \u2022 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital ( mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). \u2022 The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected. \u2022 There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (p < 0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group. \u2022 However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). [26] Severe acute respiratory syndrome: clinical and laboratory manifestations. (12) years, range 21-58] for 19 consecutive days upon hospital admission (from \u2264 2 days after disease onset). \u2022 The cytokine profile showed marked elevation of T-helper lymphocyte type 1 (Th1) cytokine IFN-\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 for at least two weeks after disease onset, but there was no significant increase in inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, Th1 cytokine IL-2, and T-helper lymphocyte type 2 (Th2) cytokine IL-4. \u2022 We have also performed serial studies of plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles of 8 children with SARS (5 boys and 3 girls, age 0.3 -6.2 years) and found that these patients had a much milder cytokine and chemokine storm, rendering the use of corticosteroids more controversial if not unjustified. \u2022 IL-6 Interleukin acts as a mediator between pro-and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans-and classical-signalling, which might relate to the cytokine storm that is triggered by excessive pro-inflammatory responses to Ebola, SARS-CoV and dengue infections in humans. \u2022 Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans-and classical-signaling \u2022 The tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro-and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. \u2022 ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes. [43] Extraordinary GU-rich singlestrand RNA identified from SARS coronavirus contributes an excessive innate immune response. \u2022 They identified a set of SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments with a high-density distribution in the genome. \u2022 In vitro experiments, the result showed the representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8, almost 2-fold higher than the strong stimulatory ssRNA40 that was found previously from other virus. \u2022 Moreover, SARS-CoV ssRNA was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate in vivo experiment. It suggests that SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA plays a very important role in the cytokine storm associated with a dysregulation of the innate immunity and could open a new therapeutic strategy. ",

From this the authors stated that the cytokine results cast doubt on the liberal use of corticosteroids in paediatric SARS patients, as the host immunologic response did not seem to be as severe as initially anticipated. The authors provide evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages and that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion. The macrophages obtained in this study were from 6-week-old female mice. Note.

Synergistic inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro by disulfiram and 6-thioguanine or mycophenolic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinically available drugs. The combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon beta 1b shows synergistic activity against MERS-CoV in Vero cells. The desirable pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid compared to ribavirin warrants further evaluation, although the potential inhibitory effect on the immune system and therefore neutralising antibody production should be fully assessed in animal models before use in humans. A fatal case of MERS was reported in a renal transplant recipient who was receiving antirejection therapy consisting of prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine, but the dosage, serum drug level of mycophenolate mofetil, and resulting lymphocyte count were not reported [80] A review of candidate therapies for Middle East respiratory syndrome from a molecular perspective.

Viral replication represents potential antiviral targets. Study performed genome-wide SARS-CoV yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen with human cDNA libraries identifying FK506-binding proteins as interaction partners of SARS-CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). FK506-binding proteins bind the immunosuppressive drug FK506 (tacrolimus). Since Nsp1 interacts with FK506-binding proteins, investigated whether FK506 inhibits replication of human coronaviruses. VeroFM cells infected with SARS-CoV and other human coronaviruses and treated with FK506. Study found that FK506 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E at non-toxic, lowmicromolar concentrations with reduction in viral titers to undetectable levels. All human coronaviruses sensitive to FK506 indicating the involvement of FK506-binding proteins in viral replication. PPIase-independent activities of CsA and FK506 exerted by gain-of-function, result from binary complexes formed by binding of the drugs to FKBPs. Based on inhibition of the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin, these complexes block the cellular calcineurin/NFAT pathway thereby interfering with T-cell activation and IL-2 production.

The authors state that they demonstrate for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family.

Current studies investigating COVID-19/ other coronavirus strains and IL-1 blockade. (continued) CoV binds to host cells via a specific SARS recep-tor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Following entry into the cell, the virus uncoats, nucleic acid is released and transcription occurs for production of viral proteins. During this course, the host immune system is activated (B and T-cells). Specifically, CD4+ T helper cells recognise antigenic peptides produced by antigen presenting cells and produce cytokines that promote cell mediated and/or humoral immunity.Similarly to avian flu, SARS infection induced similar proinflammatory cytokine pattern and might contribute to the severe nature of the virus. Clinical evidence of SARS treatment by corticosteroids where levels of IL-1beta reduced after administrationthus inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 may be beneficial strategy for treatment of SARS. Following the discovery of SARS-CoV, no specific or efficient clinical treatments were available since pathogenesis was not well understood. Acute lung injury associated with SARS can be attributed to complex and multifactorial pathophysiological process involving cytokines. Demonstrated that IL-1 play key role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury. WHO inferred that severe immune response kills SARS patients and that some cytokines may play important role in the process. IL-1 cytokine promotes inflammation by inducing cell injury. Study measured levels of IL-1 in 4 patient groups: controls, patients with SARS, patients with severe SARS and convalescent SARS patients. Study showed that levels of IL-1alpha did not differ between 3 SARS groups or controls. Suggests that host immune response to novel coronavirus may be different from the immune reaction to other pathogens.Overall results suggest that acute lung injury associated with SARS may not be induced by circulating cytokines. HOWEVER some patients had accepted corticosteroids and therefore results consistent with reports that only long term treatment (7-10 days) with a steroid can alter serum cytokine levels.Supplementary Table 6. Current studies investigating COVID-19/ other coronavirus strains and IL-1 blockade. (continued)Known that over-expression of IL-1beta hallmark of SARS infection probably through activation of transcription factor nuclear factor, activator protein AP1 and activating factor 2. Therefore lung damage associated with SARS postulated to occur through cytokine and chemokine dysregulation. Study involved measurement of cytokines and chemokines including IL-1beta in 20 consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong hospital. IL-1beta was significantly elevated above normal range within first 12, 7 and 5 days after disease onset. Those patients with more severe disease treated with pulsed methylprednisolone. IL-1beta levels higher in this patient group particularly 3-10 days after onset but returned to normal levels 1 week after disease onset in both sets of patients. IL-1beta can act as early response cytokine to viral infection. IL-1 elevation in SARS can induce hyperinnate inflammatory response leading to recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and PMN.Higher disease severity associated with more elevated plasma IL-1beta and addition of pulsed steroid controlled rapidly deteriorating clinical condition and attenuated otherwise exaggerated immunological response.SupplementaryTable 7.

The authors concluded that whilst treatment with beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil predicted survival (in univariate analysis only), the greatest predictor of survival was the severity of illness on presentation. The authors assessed 3 repurposed drugs with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate mofetil, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-\u03b21b) in common marmosets with severe disease resembling MERS in humans. all MMF-treated animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads. The authors concluded that MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be used. In vivo study in BALB/c mice (a replication model for SARS infections) In mycophenolic acid-treated mice, the lung virus titers (aka viral load) increased with increasing dosage, although these increases in lung virus titers were not quite significantly different from the lung virus titers in placebo-treated, infected mice. Mycophenolic acid also inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes. This makes it a popular immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplants and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The use of mycophenolic acid monotherapy has not been reported in MERS. IFN-b and mycophenolic acid combination therapy was described in a retrospective observational study in Saudi Arabia involving 51 patients; all of the 8 patients who received IFN-b and mycophenolic acid survived. Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid are likely to cause more harm than benefit. There are no clinical data on the efficacy of mycophenolic acid in SARS or MERS.
