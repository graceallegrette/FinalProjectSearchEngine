We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.",

PSG homologues have been identified in species with hemochorial placentation, including nonhuman primates, rats, and mice, all of which are species having several PSG genes that result in expression of several PSG proteins because of alternative splicing [6] . The function of human and murine PSGs is believed to be that of immunomodulators, as one of many reported mechanisms that prevent rejection of the allogeneic fetus by the maternal immune system. This proposed role of PSGs has been suggested by several investigators and is supported by different experimental findings, including the ability of PSGs to induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

The recognized importance of TGFB1 during the angiogenic process has been strengthened by its ability to regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, which includes VEGFs A, B, C, and D as well as placental growth factor (PGF) [13] [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, we hypothesized that PSGs may induce TGFB1 to promote immune tolerance, affect trophoblast function, and promote angiogenesis in the pregnant uterus. We explored this possibility by examining the effect of PSG1 in cell types involved with development of the placental blood supply, including primary monocyte/macrophages, low-passage primary endothelial cells, and two extravillous trophoblast cell lines.",

The results presented here suggest that PSGs could contribute to the process of establishing the maternal-fetal vasculature in two ways. First, PSG1 has the ability to induce TGFB1 and VEGFA by different cell types, including monocytes/macrophages and extravillous trophoblasts. Second, PSG1 has the capacity to interact with endothelial cells, inducing tube formation, as well as to enhance vascular morphogenetic processes induced by VEGFA.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that PSG1 could play a role in uterine angiogenesis and capillary morphogenesis. To investigate this further, we performed in vitro endothelial tube formation assays. HDMECs were cultured and seeded onto a collagen gel at passage 3 or 4 and then cultured until confluence. Afterward, they were stimulated with PSG1-Fc or the control protein (FLAG-Fc) alone or in combination with VEGFA. HDMECs exposed only to VEGFA were used as a positive control and formed tubes as expected (Fig. 5A) . Cells cultured in basal medium, the negative control, showed no tube formation (Fig. 5B ). PSG1 alone, applied at concentrations of 100 and 500 ng/ml, induced tube formation as shown in Figure  5C (100 ng/ml of PSG1). Simultaneous application of PSG1 at 25 and 100 ng/ml of VEGFA increased the network of VEGFA-induced endothelial tubes (Fig. 5D) as assessed semiquantitatively under microscopic evaluation. When the control protein FLAG-Fc was used instead of PSG1, we could not observe the formation of tubes or the increase in VEGFAmediated tube formation (data not shown). Neither PSG1-Fc nor FLAG-Fc applied at concentrations 100 and 500 ng/ml had an effect on wound distance in comparison to the negative control, in which the cells were exposed to basal medium only (data not shown). In contrast, VEGFA treatment of the cells, which was used as positive control, reduced the wounding distance within 12 h after wound induction (not shown).",

This motif is on the FG loop, which is solvent exposed and considered to be a biologically important element in CEACAM1. PSG1 has the sequence GDD rather than RGD, but the importance of this region for receptor binding and activity for all PSGs has been frequently cited [19, 20] . To investigate the possible importance of this region of the PSG1 protein, we mutated the G at position 93 and the D at position 95 to S and L, respectively. We selected the amino acids S and L based on their presence in the corresponding position in human CEACAM3. These changes are not expected to affect the folding of the protein while being substantially different from the amino acids present in wild-type PSG1. Like wild-type PSG1-Fc, the resulting protein has an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 7A) . The PSG1GDD!SDL mutant was compared to the wild-type protein for its ability to induce TGFB1 in HTR-8/SVneo, monocytes, and HEEC. Our In C, HTR-8/SVneo cells were pre-treated with 10 lg/ml of anti-TGFB1 antibody or isotype-matched control antibody (IM) 1 h before addition of 50 lg/ml of PSG1-Fc or FLAG-Fc. After 24 h, VEGFA in the supernatants was analyzed by ELISA. All cells were treated in triplicate, and data are representative of at least three independent experiments. For A, B, D, and E, statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, and the Pvalue between doses was less than 0.01. For C, statistical significance between the PSG1-Fc-treated and FLAG-Fc-treated samples was determined by two-tailed Student t-test (*P , 0.05). Error bars represent the SEM. results show that the PSG1GDD!SDL mutant induced TGFB1 over control protein (Fig. 7B) .",

These potential N-linked glycosylation sites are also conserved in all mouse PSGs and in the majority of baboon and rat PSGs. Because the importance of N-linked glycosylation and the putative salt bridge has never been explored, we introduced three mutations that render a protein without the conserved N-linked glycosylation sites and the ability to form the salt bridge.

Even at later stages of pregnancy, the placental vasculature continues to be remodeled to enable blood flow to the increasing metabolic demands of the fetus. Sufficient uteroplacental blood flow requires remodeling of the spiral arteries by the extravillous trophoblasts [43] . Failure of spiral artery remodeling has been associated with complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction [44] [45] [46] .

PSG1 induced endothelial cell tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. When VEGFA was added to the cells together with PSG1, we observed that the network was enhanced over the cells in which PSG1 or VEGFA was added alone. Further experiments are required to determine the molecular and signaling mechanisms by which PSG1 induces endothelial tube formation. Tube formation likely is not the result of induction of VEGFA by PSG1, because we did not observe significant PSG1-mediated VEGFA secretion in endothelial cells at PSG1 concentrations employed in the tube assays. Additionally, we did not observe an increase in endothelial cell migration upon PSG1 treatment, which would be expected as a result of up-regulation of VEGFA. Therefore, while PSG1 may increase the availability of VEGFA in the placenta, the effect on endothelial cells, because of its ability to induce VEGFA secretion from other cell types, may be of a paracrine nature or could be mediated by the observed up-regulation of TGFB1. PSGs belong to the CEA family, and it is interesting to note that other members of this family, which are membrane bound, have been implicated in the processes of immunoregulation, human trophoblast invasion, and angiogenesis [27, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] .",

            "text": "The PSG concentration increases progressively to reach a plateau in the last 4 wk of pregnancy. At 200 lg/ml, PSGs are the most abundant fetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during late pregnancy [62] . At this time, and to our knowledge, no specific antibodies can distinguish the different members of the human PSG family, but splice variants for most of them have been reported to be expressed, with most of these including the N-domain [19] . Recently, transcripts for PSG1 were found in sperm, and PSG1 protein was detected during zygotic development, suggesting a possible role for this protein in the early stages of embryogenesis and/or implantation [63] . Within the N-domain, most PSGs have an RGD or an RGDlike sequence. The RGD motif forms the minimal functional binding unit in some integrin ligands [64] , and its presence in one of the solvent-exposed loops of most PSGs was assumed to be required for PSG function [20] . Within this sequence, the conservation of the aspartic acid (D) at position 95 has been cited as essential for function [18, 19] . Our results indicate that at least for some functions of PSGs, the G in position 93 and the D at position 95 are not essential. Binding assays showed that although the PSG1GDD!SDL mutant binds to target cells, such as HTR-8/SVneo, significantly over the control protein, the binding (measured as mean fluorescence intensity) was approximately half that of the wild-type protein. Whether other, as-yet-unknown functions of this protein could be mediated by these amino acids, or how the mutation affects the affinity of the interaction with the receptor, remains to be determined.",

Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that enzymatic removal of N-linked carbohydrates with peptide-N-glycosidase F results in a significant reduction of the activity of the protein. In addition, we have previously established that N-linked glycosylation is required for interaction of murine PSG17 with CD9 [65] .
