By plotting the mortality rate against the incidence of the disease (cumulative number of confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, per 10000 population) they have found a significant positive correlation, suggesting that mortality is correlated with healthcare burden and, consequently, with healthcare resource availability.",

In this way, it has been estimated that 41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment is not on average operating near or at capacity in terms of national numbers and it is worth mentioning that this ICU availability rate is 7\u00b76 percentage points larger than in the United States. 5 On the other hand, the Brazilian rate of existing (adult) ICU beds per 10000 (1\u00b704) is less than a third of the United States value in the year of 2009 (3\u00b747). 6 Moreover, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between the states of Brazil (including its federal capital territory). The remarkable differences between federated units reflect into the number of possible admissions per day of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for each of the three levels of hospital equipment usage, as shows Table 5 .",
