            "text": "Grazing dormant forage requires less labor and machinery than feeding harvested forages, but may not meet the nutrient requirements of the pregnant cow in the last trimester of pregnancy. Supplemental nutrients are often fed to cows grazing dormant forage to correct nutrient deficiencies. Research has determined only 0.14 kg/cow/d of supplemental rumen degradable protein is necessary to maintain body condition score (BCS) of gestating cows grazing winter range in the Nebraska Sandhills (Hollingsworth-Jenkins et al., 1996) . However, the amount required to maintain BCS may not be the same as the amount required to prevent deleterious effects of undernutrition on fetal development. Undernutrition during gestation causes suboptimal conditions in the maternal uterine environment, which translates into decreased progeny performance (Wu et al, 2006) . Supplementing cows grazing winter range during the last trimester of gestation has been shown to increase calf body weight (BW) at weaning (Stalker et al., 2006 (Stalker et al., , 2007 , but it is not known if the amount of supplement fed was sufficient to optimize progeny performance. An alternative to feeding supplement is to wean the calf. Moving the weaning date earlier in the year allows spring-calving cows to enter late gestation in greater BCS (Stalker et al., 2007) . This increased BCS may serve as a nutrient reservoir to buffer effects of undernutrition. An additional strategy may be to allow cows to graze corn residue during the winter because mature cows gain more BW and BCS grazing corn residue than winter range (Larson et al., 2009; Griffin et al., 2012) . We hypothesized weaning date would interact with winter nutritional plane where cows assigned to a later weaning date would exhibit a greater response to a better nutritional plane during the winter than cows assigned to an earlier weaning date. Therefore, the objectives of this experiment were to evaluate long-term effects of prepartum nutritional plane and weaning date and their interaction on cow reproduction; heifer progeny growth and reproduction; and steer progeny growth, feedlot performance, and carcass characteristics.",

Mean ambient temperature averaged 23, 24, 25, 24 \u00b0C over the 3-mo treatment period for each of the 4 yr and precipitation averaged 12.7, 79.2, 23.6, and 34.5 mm. Cows were stratified by BW within age and treatments were assigned randomly in a 2 \u00d7 4 factorial arrangement: 1) weaning in early October (OCT) or early December (DEC); and 2) from December 1 to February 28 cows were fed the equivalent of 0, 0.41, or 0.82 kg DM/cow/d of a supplement (Table 1) delivered 3 d/wk on dormant winter range (WR0, WR1, WR2, respectively), or grazed corn residue without supplement (CR). Cows assigned to CR treatment were transported 146 km to the West Central Water Research Laboratory, near Brule, NE (lat 41.03\u00b0N, long 101.97\u00b0W, elevation 1,091 m) December 1 then returned to GSL February 20. Winter treatments were applied on a pasture basis (n = 12 cows per pasture), and pastures contained both OCT and DEC cows. Dormant upland range or corn residue forage was not limiting at any time. Each group of cows assigned to the same weaning date treatment within the same winter pasture served as the experimental unit. Each treatment combination applied to the cows was replicated three times within year (n = 6 cows per treatment combination replicate per year). Cows remained on the same weaning and winter nutritional treatments for the duration of the experiment. To begin the experiment (2008) the weaning treatment (October or December) was imposed on pregnant, lactating cows, but data from the calf weaned at initiation of the experiment were not included. Calf data were only collected on calves born to cows that received both treatments during gestation (2009 to 2012). A production year began at weaning (October or December yr 1) and lasted until the subsequent weaning (October or December yr 2). Because data were collected for four consecutive year, cow BW and BCS data collected at the end of one production year served as the initial data for the subsequent production year. In total, there were 72 cows each year in each weaning treatment for a total of 288 cows per weaning date over 4 yr. During the winter period, there were 12 cows per pasture and 3 pastures per treatment, for a total of 36 cows per winter treatment each year, and a total of 144 cows per treatment over 4 yr. Simple effects of winter treatment and weaning date totaled 72 cows per treat over the 4 yr. Only pregnant cows were used to begin each production year, therefore pregnant cows were added to replace culls and keep numbers constant among year.",

Prior to calving (March 1), cows were vaccinated against Clostridium perfringens C, Escherichia coli, Rotavirus, Coronavirus (ScourGuard 4KC; Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY). Cows were fed hay ad libitum [7.6% crude protein (CP), 58.2% total digestible nutrients (TDN)] from March 1 until the start of the breeding season.

Calving rate was calculated by dividing the number of cows to calve by the number of cows to begin each production year.

Cows were estrus synchronized and artificial insemination (AI) with semen from the same two bulls the entire duration of the study. Prior to weaning and winter grazing treatment assignment the first year, cows received GnRH (100 \u03bcg i.m.) and a controlled internal drug release (CIDR; 1.38 g of progesterone; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) on d 0 and prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 (PG; 25 mg i.m.; Prostamate, Agri Laboratories, St. Joseph, MO) and CIDR removal on d 7. Estrus was detected and cows were AI for 4 d. Administering progesterone prior to initiation enabled the study to begin with cows in a similar stage of gestation because supplementation began and ended on the same day for all cows. Progesterone may have masked treatment effects on reproductive performance, therefore progesterone was not used to synchronize estrus once data collection commenced. Every subsequent breeding season estrus was synchronized with two injections of PG 14 d apart, followed by estrus detection and AI for 6 d. Cows were then placed with fertile bulls (1:20 bull:cow) for 45 d. Pregnancy was determined via rectal palpation or ultrasonography by a veterinarian at October weaning.

In yr 1 and 2 steers were placed into 1 of 8 pens based on dam weaning and winter grazing treatment where feed bunk space was adequate (\u226550.8 cm/ steer) and did not limit steer performance. In yr 3 and 4 steers were finished in a common pen using a GrowSafe automated feeding system (GrowSafe Systems Ltd., Airdrie, Alberta, Canada) to collect individual animal intake. Upon arrival at the feedlot, steers were adapted (21 d) to a common finishing diet of 48% dry rolled corn, 40% corn gluten feed, 7% grass hay, and 5% supplement (2.17 and 1.49 Mcal/ kg NEm and NEg, respectively). Approximately 100 d prior to slaughter, steers were re-implanted with Revalor S (120-mg trenbolone acetate and 8-mg estradiol, Intervet Schering Plough) and administered an ectoparasiticide (Dectomax, Pfizer Animal Health). Because steers were pen fed in yr 1 and 2, dry matter intake (DMI) was adjusted within pen for average BW of individual animal, but actual DMI was used in yr 3 and 4. Slaughter occurred when 12th rib fat thickness was visually estimated to be 1.27 cm. A commercial abattoir was used for slaughter (Tyson, Lexington, NE or National Beef, Dodge City, KS), and carcass data were collected by trained personnel after a 24-h chill. Final BW was calculated from hot carcass weight (HCW) with an assumed dressing percentage (63%).",

Progeny BW increased parallel to dam nutritional plane during late gestation for the DEC weaning treatment. Calves weaned in October gained 0.18 kg/d more from October to December than calves weaned in December and BW gain during this period was not affected (P = 0.29) by winter grazing treatment. This indicates the amount of supplement provided to OCT-weaned progeny was greater than necessary, since the goal was to achieve similar BW in December from both weaning treatments. There were no differences in morbidity or mortality based on dam treatment.",

            "text": "Heifers weaned in OCT were 13 kg heavier (P < 0.01) in December than heifers weaned in DECs (Table 4 ). They remained heavier at pre-breeding (May, P < 0.01) and pregnancy determination (October, P = 0.02) BW of OCT-weaned heifers was 11 and 9 kg greater, respectively, than DEC-weaned contemporaries. This BW advantage for OCT heifers was a function of gain during the first 60 d after weaning because heifer average daily gain (ADG) from December weaning to subsequent breeding (May) and from breeding to pregnancy determination (October) was similar (P > 0.12) between weaning treatments. Heifers from WR0 dams weighed less (P < 0.01) in December and tended (P = 0.07) to weigh less at breeding (May) but weighed the same (P = 0.26) as other winter grazing treatments at pregnancy determination (October). Story et al. (2000) found early-weaned heifers had decreased subsequent BW but BW was similar across treatments at breeding. The difference in response to weaning in Story et al. (2000) and the current experiment is likely due to postweaning management of early-weaned calves. Because OCT calves were supplemented on DM basis 0.41 kg/calf /d for 60 d, BW in December was greater than DEC calves. Compensatory gain of DEC heifers was observed during summer grazing, but was not great enough to equalize BW at pregnancy diagnosis. The percentage cycling before breeding and pregnancy rates were similar (P > 0.13) for any treatment. Percentage of heifers cycling ranged from 13% to 55% among treatments. Sexten et al. (2005) weaned heifers at 89 or 232 d and found early weaning increased percentage of heifers pubertal at 8 mo. Results in the current study may be due to different postweaning ADG between studies. Corah et al. (1975) observed no difference in age at puberty between heifers born to dams severely restricted during the last 100 d of gestation and heifers from non-restricted dams. In a recent review by Broadhead et al. (2019) it was indicated that results on the effect of dam supplementation and weaning time have been inconsistent on reproductive parameters in subsequent heifer progeny and more consistent on growth characteristics and proposed that inconsistencies are likely due to severity of restriction and environmental conditions of individual studies.",

            "text": "Feedlot entry BW of steers weaned in OCT was 17 kg greater (P < 0.01) than DEC-weaned steers (Table 5) . Steer progeny had similar (P \u2265 0.31) DMI and ADG in the feedlot, regardless of weaning treatment. Feed efficiency tended (P = 0.07) to be greater for DEC-weaned steers. Hot carcass weight tended (P = 0.09) to be greater for OCTweaned steers, likely because OCT-weaned steers were heavier at feedlot entry and were on feed for the same number of days as DEC-weaned steers. Although OCT-weaned steers tended (P = 0.09) to have greater 12th rib fat thickness, weaning date did not affect (P \u2265 0.19) longissimus muscle (LM) area, marbling score, or yield grade. Myers et al. (1999) observed improved feedlot ADG when steer calves were weaned at 90 and 152 d compared with 215 d. Similarly, Fluharty et al. (2000) found a 5% improvement in G:F when steers were weaned 100 d earlier than contemporaries. However, Stalker et al. (2007) found early-weaned steers entered the feedlot weighing 38 kg less and consumed 0.5 kg DM/d less than late-weaned steers. The primary difference between the feedlot performance data in these experiments is the feedlot entry BW from different studies. Animals entering the feedlot at a heavier BW, regardless of weaning treatment, are expected to consume more DM and be less efficient than lighter animals when harvested at a similar end point. Steers born to dams on a higher nutritional plane were heavier at feedlot entry (P < 0.01), with steers born to WR1, WR2, and CR dams having 9, 14, and 22 kg greater initial BW than steers born to WR0 cows, respectively. DMI and G:F were similar across winter grazing treatments. However, there was a tendency (P = 0.07) for steers born to WR2 and CR dams to have greater feedlot ADG than steers born to WR0 and WR1 dams. Steers born to WR2 and CR dams had 14 and 22 kg greater (P = 0.02) HCW than steers born to WR0 cows, respectively. Dam winter grazing treatment did not affect (P \u2265 0.21) LM area, marbling score, or yield grade. Twelfth rib fat thickness was greatest (P = 0.01) for steers born to CR dams, and least for steers born to WR0 dams, with steers from WR1 and WR2 dams being intermediate. Both Bohnert et al. (2013) and Stalker et al. (2006) found no differences in any carcass characteristics between steers born to dams with and without prepartum supplementation. Steer performance results are likely a consequence, at least in part, of late gestation nutrition on fetal growth. Across domestic livestock species, intrauterine growth restriction caused from inadequate maternal nutrition decreases feed efficiency, increases whole-body and intramuscular fat, and decreases meat quality of progeny (Wu et al., 2006) .",

Studies that have reported an increase in weaning weight by protein supplementation have illustrated that increased in weight continues on through to the end product of carcass.

This could be due to differences in long-term herd management, environmental conditions, genetic makeup of the cowherd, and metabolic efficiency and adaptability to cope with environmental factors of the cowherd. In general, protein supplementation during late-gestation tends to have a positive impact on steer growth with increased weaning weight and carcass weights at slaughter (Broadhead, et al., 2019) .",
