In a post hoc analysis of patients with lymphopenia, the proportion who developed an LRTC through Day 28 was 51% lower following treatment with presatovir, as compared to the placebo; other post hoc analyses also indicated trends toward a treatment effect on LRTCs. The results suggest lessons for the design of future clinical trials of drugs for RSV or other respiratory viruses in transplant recipients or other immunocompromised patients. Among healthy adults with established experimental RSV infections, presatovir treatment, as compared to the placebo treatment, significantly reduced the RSV load and clinical severity [26] . The current study did not reproduce these findings, most likely because the challenge study participants received presatovir at or before symptom onset, whereas the current study patients were treated after a median of 4 days of symptoms. An exploratory analysis revealed trends toward reduced LRTC rates following presatovir treatment, versus placebo treatment, of patients with median or shorter symptom durations (Table 2) . Future studies of anti-RSV drugs, particularly fusion inhibitors, should explore whether earlier therapy improves treatment outcomes.",

Lymphopenia is a well-described risk factor for LRTCs in RSV-infected HCT recipients [9, 12, 14, 28] , as observed in the current study (64% in placebo-treated patients with lymphopenia vs 11% in those without). Treatment with presatovir reduced the development of LRTCs in patients with lymphopenia-a surrogate marker of impaired T-cell or humoral immunity-possibly because robust immune responses masked any treatment effect by improving outcomes regardless of the treatment.

Respiratory failure and mortality are more clinically significant, but their rates in this study suggest that the sample size required would be prohibitive, especially for HCT recipients. The current study endpoint of LRTCs included multiple etiologies, because RSV URTIs may predispose patients to secondary infections-for example, by disrupting mucociliary function [29, 30] -so treatment could prevent a secondary LRTI, as well as a primary LRTI. Furthermore, any LRTC is a clinically significant event that may prolong hospitalization, necessitate intensive clinical care (including empiric antimicrobial treatment), and potentially result in death. Only a minority of LRTCs in this study were adjudicated as primary RSV LRTIs-likely due to other etiologies, as well as a lack of lower respiratory tract samples for the confirmation of RSV-underscoring the potential importance of nonviral pulmonary events in HCT recipients with RSV infections. Determining the cause of each LRTC event in a clinical trial, while ideal, requires invasive procedures (eg, bronchoscopy or lung biopsy) that could pose significant patient risks and are not globally mandated by the current clinical standard of care. Thus, radiographic confirmation, corroborated by clinical data with central, blinded adjudication, as used here, may be the best approach to classify LRTIs. Whether the near-50% relative reduction in LRTC events is clinically meaningful, despite lacking statistical significance, is left to interpretation. The consistent trends toward a treatment effect in exploratory analyses need confirmation in future studies.",
