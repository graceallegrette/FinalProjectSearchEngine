All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital\uff0cas well as offload ED resources.",

Currently, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is of primary concern [3] . The main manifestations of this disease include acute fever, cough and dyspnea [4] , thus emergency departments (EDs) have become the primary facilities providing initial diagnoses and medical care for potential COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, as the virus spreads widely, crowded patients in EDs face a high risk of cross-infection [5, 6] . In mainland China, outpatient \"fever clinics\" (FCs), affiliated to the ED, are designed to help separate potentially infectious from non-infectious patients [7] . FCs were started at the suggestion of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China as early as 2003 during the SARS outbreak in China Even after the SARS event, FCs were still preserved as a location near EDs for early identification and isolation of potentially infectious patients [8] . Therefore, few suspected patients were managed in emergency department [9] . However, between SARS in 2003 and the current COVID-19 outbreak, the FC system has seen few similar stresses and few reports have emerged about this potentially key element of hospital infection-prevention infrastructure.",

After the COVID-19 outbreak, as many as twelve doctors wearing \"grade-3\" isolation gowns worked in the FC [10] . Two consulting rooms were added to supplement the original single-room. The number of medical care providers providing in-person coverage every 24 hours increased from two to nine every 24 hours, while nursing staff increased from nine to 15 every 24 hours.

FC took responsibility for screening SARS-COV-2, in addition to influenza and eruptive diseases noted above. All acquired nucleic acid samples were tested by two independent laboratories that had been authorized by the Beijing Municipal Health Commission. Only \"double negative\" results was defined as a negative result for the patient. In addition to identification, there were specialized doctors in charge of suspected patients, critical patients and common patients, respectively. Negative pressure isolation wards with complete sets of resuscitation equipment were readied for any critical patients. Once the screening tests were reported, confirmed patients would be transferred to specialized hospitals whereas others who needed further treatment were transferred into the ED (see Figure 2 ).",

This widely spreading disease became a notifiable infectious disease starting on January 20, 2020 per the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Starting on January 20, the Beijing Municipal Government initiated a level-1 (highest) public health response to prevent the spread of the disease [12] . PUMCH upgraded the FC that same day to enhance the screening and treatment of potential COVID-19 patients. In this study, we reviewed the details of the FC in the 40 days before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We found that after the outbreak, more patients received treatment in FC, critically ill patients received initial rescue management in the FC, and, most importantly, no confirmed COVID-19 patients were transferred to the ED and no other patients, doctors or nurses were infected in the hospital. This FC upgrate strategy seemed to successfully prevent COVID-19 from spreading. infection syndromes [13] , but they also are strongly infectious, which causes dramatic difficulties in screening. Consequently, it was not possible to exclude COVID-19 merely based on clinical symptoms [14] . We found that patients' average age trended older after the outbreak [15] . A reasonable explanation for this was that patients with relatively severe diseases had to seek medical care in hospitals even though they faced a high risk of cross-infection with COVID-19. Older people generally have a higher risk of severe disease, but this difference did not exist in critically ill patients, likely because most critical patients were elderly people.",

Before the outbreak, the major work of the FC was identifying influenza, which might take about half an hour. Once negative results were reported, patients could be transferred to the ED with limited precautions. Once COVID-19 hit, frequent transfers between the FC and ED might cause crowded situations in the ED and increase exposure risks. Our data showed a lower transfer rate after the outbreak, likely due to increasing amounts of medical treatment (as opposed to just testing before the outbreak) in the FC. To those patients who were finally transferred to the ED within 24 hours, a longer FC retention time was observed due to the prolonged screening time for COVID-19. During their time in the FC, patients received treatments aimed at decreasing the number of patients in the ED. Even though some patients had to seek further medical advice in the ED, initial treatments given in the FC might also shorten their length of stay in the ED.",

Unfortunately, 11.5% of COVID-19 patients did not manifest fever, but as many as 82.4% of patients had respiratory symptoms, such as cough, expectoration and dyspnea [12] . These phenomena impelled us to expand screening criteria. Thus, all patients meeting one or more of the following conditions had to be screened in the FC: positive COVID-19 contact exposure, fever or respiratory symptoms. With this new criteria, the number of FC patients grew dramatically in the 40 days after January 20, 2020.",

In our screening process, multiple methods, including blood cell analysis, chest CT [16] , SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid [17] and antibody tests [18] were used to screen for this disease. However, each method had its own false negative phenomena, therefore all patients suspected of any viral infection were recommended to receive another nucleic acid test once more in 24 hours, which helped guarantee that patients who didn't retest again and were transferred to the ED within 24 hours had an extremely low risk of COVID-19. Additionally, in order to avoid false negative results, patients with the following conditions were suggested to test for SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid once again one week later, even though previous RNA tests were negative twice: (1) confirmed COVID-19 contact history; (2) clinical manifestations and lab tests suggesting a viral infection unexplained by another disease; (3) chest CT strongly indicating a viral pneumonia. With these strict screening criteria, no COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in ED patients previously seen in the FC.",

According to their COVID-19 contact history and clinical severity, patients were allocated to one of three specialized regions of the FC. First, patients with positive contact histories were suggested to keep a person-to-person distance of at least two meters before further history details were investigated, and only when all tests were reported negative could they leave the FC. Second, critical patents identified at the triage counter were immediately admitted to rescue rooms where experienced physicians would provide further assessment and initial resuscitation. Thus, before the results of the screening tests came out,patients were all treated as potentially infected. Once negative results were reported, they could be transferred to the ED resuscitation rooms; otherwise they would continue being treated in the FC or transferred to dedicated receiving hospitals for COVID-19. Third, FC patients could now begin to receive initial treatment(s) as soon as possible without waiting for transfer to the ED.",
