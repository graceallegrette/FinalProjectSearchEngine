In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea. Methods: All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness. Results: The median age was 40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common (10.7%). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six patients (21.4%) required J Korean Med Sci. 2020 Apr 6;35(13):e142 https://doi.",

The first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in Korea was a traveler from Wuhan, China in January 19th, 2020. 4 While the spread of COVID-19 was limited before February 20, 5,6 a huge outbreak occurred among a religious group in the southern part of Korea, Daegu, and the number of COVID-19 cases in Korea reached 6,593 on March 6th, 2020. 7, 8 While clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 have been described in China by several investigations, 9-14 most of them focused on SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia in China. There is still uncertainty about the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19, especially outside of China where patients can be detected in the early course of disease by the quarantine system. Recently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported epidemiological features of the earliest 28 COVID-19 cases in Republic of Korea. 15 We performed this study to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Republic of Korea, including radiological and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness.",

Although they had radiological pneumonia, they did not feel unwell and were able to carry on their daily activities as usual (\"walking pneumonia\"). The titers of SARS-CoV-2 shedding from the URT were very high from the prodromal phase of illness until day 5 of illness. In our patient cohort, the clinical features of COVID-19 during the prodromal phase were insidious and mild. Fever was absent in 75.0% of the patients at the time of admission. Throat symptoms, such as pain, discomfort and globus sensation and cough were ranked as relatively common, but only 1/3 had these symptoms. As the prodromal symptoms were mild and did not begin abruptly, most of the patients were not able to tell exactly when they had become ill. And because of this benign nature of the prodromal symptoms, they did not realize that they had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and went out to carry on usual activities, while spreading the virus inadvertently.",

During the prodromal phase, only 1/3 of our patients developed any clinical features suggesting pneumonia, such as cough, sputum, or chest discomfort. Chest radiographs on hospitalization did not reveal any infiltrates in more than 50% of patients. However, chest CT scans, which were performed on hospitalization or within 1-2 days, showed infiltrates in the lungs suggesting viral pneumonia in 16/18 (88.9%) patients ( Table 1) . If we had not taken CT scans of the lungs, we would have easily missed the pneumonia diagnosis. 4 The radiological pneumonia from CT scan was detected as early as day 1 of illness onset. The most common findings of CT scans were bilateral, ground-glass opacity in the periphery of the lungs as described in previous studies. 9,11,12 Despite radiological pneumonia, the patients were clinically stable and mobile during the first week of illness (\"walking pneumonia\"). We assessed the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia using the chest radiograph scoring, and it remained stable during the first week of illness, but increased around the day 7 of illness. This pattern of pneumonia progression was also noted in patients with MERS-CoV infection. 18 The early onset of the lung infiltrates and few clinical manifestations of LRT infection may suggest that the virus can invade into the LRT, evading innate immune mechanisms and replicate before adaptive immune response begins to play a role. A tissue biopsy and immunohistopathological studies of the lungs may elucidate this unique and interesting clinical feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Recently, China CDC reported that they isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a stool sample taken 15 days after illness onset of a laboratory confirmed patient. 22 The possibilities of fecalto-oral transmission and opportunistic aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remain to be determined. 23 It is important to note that the virus titers in the respiratory specimens peaked on early days after illness onset ( Fig. 2A and B) . Of the seven infectors of our cohort, two transmitted the virus on the first day of illness, one on the 8th day of illness, and 4 via household transmission. The Ct values of the URT specimens ranged from 18-25 in the 4 infectors within the 5 days of illness: 18.74, 18.33, 25.12, and 21.5 for each patient. Our data suggest that the viral shedding from the URT may reach its peak during the first 3-5 days after illness onset. A recent study on virus shedding kinetics is also in line with our finding. 24 This \"shift to the left\" pattern of virus shedding kinetics is strikingly different from that of SARS-CoV, which shows an inverted V pattern, with its peak at day 10 of illness. 25 Also of note is that 57.1% (4/7) of infectors had cough or sputum, in contrast to only 23.8% (5/21) of non-infectors having cough. These findings suggest that the transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 may occur easily and begin from the prodromal phase of illness, just like common cold or influenza viruses. Considering that the median time from symptom onset to isolation of the patients was 3 days, and that high titers of virus shedding began from day 1 of illness with the peak around day 3-5 of illness, early detection and isolation strategy may be relatively less effective in containing the virus in COVID-19.",

As of 17 February 2020, no patient required supplemental oxygen therapy with mechanical ventilation nor any organ-supporting treatments in intensive care unit. A total of 10 cases have fully recovered There are some limitations in our study. Only 28 patients from our cohort were included in this study. However, we gathered and analyzed the detailed clinical information about all of the first 28 cases nationwide in Republic of Korea. Moreover, some cases were confirmed during the surveillance test for COVID-19 after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of elderly patients and frequency of underlying conditions were small, and therefore the first 28 patients from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea had relatively favorable outcomes. 26 Most of the enrolled patients would be healthier than the population of recent larger outbreaks showing worse outcomes, mostly in the elderly group. The results regarding outcomes in this study should be interpreted cautiously. In most cases, we did not perform virologic tests for coinfection of other respiratory viruses such as influenza.",
