            "text": "After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.",

We found that three-quarters of Wuhan's floating population are from Hubei Province, and that nearly 85% migrated with nuclear families. The number of members per family is 3 to 4, and most individuals are migrant workers from rural areas with low education levels. By comparing the predicted and actual values obtained from the model, we analysed the profile of the epidemic in various regions since January 25, and found that the spread of the 2019-nCoV has varied greatly between regions, and that the epidemic in some regions may be underestimated. There may also be unknowns, such as structural factors in some regions, that deserve further attention.",

The results indicate that the floating population of Wuhan is centred in Hubei Province and the surrounding provinces, so local government must quickly and effectively take steps to prevent further spread of 2019-nCoV. Higher-level governments must also strengthen the assistance they are providing, such as sending medical workers and medical supplies to these areas to avoid 2019-nCoV becoming a new pandemic. At the same time, it is important to increase surveillance in areas where the epidemic may be underestimated, and promptly identify prevention and control loopholes to reduce the burden of a new round of transmission.",

Third, the medical treatment ability of regional medical centres of Hubei Province would also be the same, as the breakout emerged so fast that these regional medical centres would have had the same level of emergency-preparedness.

The prediction of floating population in Wuhan based on the statistics from previous years is presented in Table 3 , demonstrating that there were approximately 2.43 million migrants living in Wuhan for more than six months in 2019. However, if the predictions of the statistical data were combined with survey data, which was used in this study to estimate the origin of Wuhan's floating population that return to their hometowns, there would have been a problem with inconsistent statistical strength. This would have resulted from the fact that the floating population measured by the government statistics department reflects those who have lived in Wuhan for more than 6 months, but the respondents in the survey have lived in Wuhan for over one month. A shorter defined residence time would have therefore produced a larger estimate of the population, and thus the total floating population in Wuhan, as determined from the CMDS data, was larger than the population as determined by the government statistics department.",

Table 10 compares the number of individuals travelling from Wuhan to other provinces and the daily number of confirmed cases for those other provinces. Analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient at the provincial level was lower than at the prefecture level within Hubei Province, but the correlation coefficient increased from 0.4 on 25 January 2020 to 0.63 on 31 January 2020. Table 10 also shows the ratio of confirmed cases in each province to the proportion of people in the floating population in Wuhan who originate from each of these provinces, on 28 January 2020. We divide provinces into two categories based on their short-term travel populations in Wuhan, and Wuhan's travelling population to other provinces during the Spring Festival holiday. The first category comprises those provinces that have large-scale short-term business trips or tourist populations in Wuhan during the Spring Festival holiday, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hainan. Obviously, such a high level of inter-provincial population mobility may exacerbate the spread of 2019-nCoV. For example, the high ratio of confirmed cases in Guangdong Province may be due to the large short-term travel populations visiting Shenzhen and Guangzhou and Wuhan, while the high ratio of confirmed cases in Hainan Province may result from the outbound tourist population from Wuhan to Hainan during the Spring Festival holiday. In Table 10 , the results are divided into two parts: the correlation coefficient of the first category of provinces, which reaches a maximum of 0.96, and the correlation coefficient of the second category of provinces, which increased from 0.56 to 0.7. This abovementioned second category comprise the other 25 provinces that have small short-term business trip groups or tourist populations in Wuhan during the Spring Festival holiday. We assumed that the effect of the floating population on the spread of 2019-nCoV was consistent across the country. The other 25 provinces are divided into three groups since 25 January 2020 ( Figure 4) : (1) Provinces with a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Yunnan; (2) Provinces with a moderate increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hebei, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Qinghai, Jilin, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Ningxia; and (3) Provinces with a small increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi.

We found that: (1) The epidemic growth model of Henan Province does not fit the situation in most other provinces. That is, except in Anhui and Jiangxi, the actual number of outbreaks in other provinces was higher than that predicted by the Henan model. As these provinces have large floating populations in Wuhan, the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi may result from effective measures that have been taken to control the spread of 2019-nCoV, or the lack of sufficient diagnostic capabilities to detect suspected cases. (2) The epidemic growth model for Hunan and Sichuan Province predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. Thus, if the epidemic pattern in Hunan and Sichuan follows a typical evolutionary pattern, the current numbers of confirmed cases in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi are greatly underestimated. For example, the number of confirmed cases in Henan on 31 January 2020 would be between 860 and 889, but the number in official announcements was only 168.

The Spring Festival in 2020 is much earlier than in previous years. At this time, the possibility of human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus had just been discovered. When the Wuhan Municipal Government decided on 23 January 2020 to \"close the city\" to control the outflow of population, more than 5 million people had already left Wuhan on the Spring Festival holiday, and it was too late to control the entire potentially infected population in the epidemic area. At present, China's high-speed railway and expressway transportation network has experienced great development. This fast and convenient transportation has led to a floating population that can leave the source area to quickly reach every part of the country, which makes it very difficult to quarantine the floating population leaving the source area through transportation stations. In addition, there is an incubation period after human infection, further increasing the difficulty of quarantine at traffic stations, which is also an important reason for the implementation of \"city closure\" control policies in many cities across the country.",

For this reason, the central government has issued an executive order to extend the Spring Festival holiday from 30 January to 2 February 2020. Many provinces are even requiring firms to not restart work until 9 February, except those necessary for social operations related to the national economy and people's livelihood.

Due to the fact that 5 million migrants had left Wuhan before the \"closure of the city\", our research reveals a high correlation between the number of Wuhan's floating population and the number of confirmed cases. Fortunately, the origin of Wuhan's floating population is highly concentrated in Hubei Province and its surrounding provinces, of which the migrants with Hubei household registers account for 75%, and more than 80% of the population is concentrated in the top 30 districts and counties. This means that some areas will face a very high risk of epidemic outbreaks, but it is also conducive to centralised resources enabling prevention and control of the epidemic to avoid large-scale spread in other regions.",

            "text": "More than 5 million of Wuhan's floating population have returned to their hometowns as potential carriers of the virus and may become carriers of the virus's re-transmission. Due to China's urban and rural dualistic structure, most of these people are rural migrant workers with low levels of education. The results find that 85% of the migrants have rural household registers. These people, who frequently work outdoors or work overtime are more likely to be susceptible because of their poor diet and nutrition. At the same time, most of these people travel with 3-4 family members, and the susceptible and high-risk population over 40 years old accounts for a large proportion of this floating population, which provides ideal conditions for the transmission of 2019-nCoV within families. To make matters worse, the rural areas where these people return to have very limited medical and public health services, and gatherings during the Spring Festival aggravate the risk of virus transmission in the community.",

            "text": "So far, confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV continue to increase every day across China. The results of our model analysis indicate that, on the one hand, the correlation between the size of the floating population and the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan has continued to increase over time, and by 28 January, the correlation coefficient of these factors in Hubei Province had reached 0.78, which means that the size of the floating population in Wuhan is an important parameter for predicting the epidemic. On the other hand, we also found that the effect of the size of the floating population in Wuhan is heterogeneous across regions. Some areas have a large floating population in Wuhan, including Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and Xiaogan City, Jingzhou City, and the three county-level cities directly under the provincial government, and yet the number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV is apparently relatively small. However, we believe that the epidemic situation in these areas may be underestimated. Considering the serious consequences of delays in diagnosis and loopholes in infection control in suspected or confirmed cases of SARS in the SARS epidemic in 2003, it is necessary to strengthen surveillance in these areas to determine the causes of the fewer confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in these areas.",

            "text": ": (1) Prefectures with a rapid increase in confirmed cases, comprising Jingmen, Xianning, Xiangyang, Ezhou, Yichang, and Enshi;(2) Prefectures with a moderate growth in confirmed cases, comprising Huanggang, Suizhou, Huangshi, and Shennongjia; and (3) Prefectures with a slow increase in confirmed cases, comprising Xiaogan, DMP cities, and Jingzhou.Our predictions of the epidemic trends of the 2019-nCoV outbreak within Hubei Province are as follows: (1) The epidemic growth model for Jingmen predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Xiaogan, DMP cities, and Jingzhou. In other words, if the epidemic pattern in Jingmen is regarded as a typical evolutionary pattern of the spread of 2019-nCoV, the actual number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Xiaogan, DMP cities, and Jingzhou have been greatly underestimated. For example, the number of confirmed cases in Xiaogan on 31 January 2020 would reach 1190, but the number of officially announced cases was only 541. This could be attributable to a lack of sufficient diagnostic capabilities, or undisclosed data from the government, or both. (2) The epidemic growth model for Xiaogan predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in Jingmen, Xianning, Xiangyang, Ezhou, Yichang and Enshi. If this is true, large-scale outbreaks have occurred in these places, but their regional governments have either not detected this, or true figures are not available or revealed. (3) The epidemic growth model for Huanggang better fits the actual epidemic situation of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, based on the floating population and the intensity of medical intervention. The outbreak in Xiaogan, DMP cities, and Jingzhou may be underestimated, while the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Jingmen, Xianning, and Xiangyang may be affected by other unknown factors or uncontrollable random factors that need further investigation.",
