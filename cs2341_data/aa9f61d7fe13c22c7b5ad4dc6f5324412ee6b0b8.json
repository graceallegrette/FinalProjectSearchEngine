            "text": "What will be the global impact of the novel coronavirus ? Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty. The risks are far from symmetric as underestimating its spread like a pandemic and not doing enough to contain it is much more severe than overspending and being over careful when it will not be needed. This paper describes the timeline of a live forecasting exercise with massive potential implications for planning and decision making and provides objective forecasts for the confirmed cases of COVID-19.",

We emphasise the importance of the recovered cases, which is not covered in media as widely as the confirmed cases or the deaths. While all three data patterns show an exponential increase, the trends of both the confirmed cases and the deaths were reduced in the mid of February; a second exponential increase is observed in late February and March as a result of the increased number of cases in South Korea, Iran, and Europe. At the same time, the number of recovered cases is steadily increasing.",

Exponential smoothing models can capture a variety of trend and seasonal forecasting patterns (such as additive or multiplicative) and combinations of those. We limit our attention to trended and non-seasonal models, given the patterns observed in Fig 1. Note that we follow a pragmatic approach in that we assume that the trend will continue indefinitely in the future.

We focus on the number of the recovered cases as a percentage of the total confirmed cases as well as the ratio of recovered cases versus deaths. We are particularly interested in the trajectory of these two ratios. Fig 3 presents this analysis. First, we observe the solid relationship between the two curves. Second, we notice that despite the very small percentages of recovered cases until the end of January (less than 2%), currently, about 1 out of 2 confirmed cases have recovered (52.8% of the total confirmed cases). Moreover, the ratio of recovered cases versus deaths is currently above 14:1. Despite this, we observe a reverse of both curves since 08/03/ 2020, which is associated with the increasing number of cases outside Mainland China.",

The Chinese authorities managed to rapidly construct two new hospitals, in Huoshenshan and Leishenshan areas in Wuhan, that opened on 03/02/2020 and 08/02/2020 respectively. Multiple commuting restrictions were applied both within China and internationally. The World Health Organisation helped in creating awareness of the novel virus.

The slowing down of the trend during this period suggested that COVID-19 would not cause any serious problems, particularly outside of Mainland China. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The last two sets of forecasts that cover the period 02/03/2020 to 21/03/2020 show a significant increase in the trend of cases globally coupled with an increase in the associated uncertainty.
