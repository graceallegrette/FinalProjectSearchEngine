Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low levels of exposed and infectious numbers that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results point to a two-step control strategy that begins with some level of confinement to reduce R below 1, followed by sufficient mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining R at approximately 1.",

The model's intuitive results emphasize the necessity to adopt one or both of two strategies: 'suppression measures' that are engaged early and decisively to lower the reproduction number, R0, as close as possible to 0. When successful, this results in low, manageable numbers of infections, and can then be followed by 'mitigation measures' that flatten the epidemic curve by maintaining the reproduction number to approximately 1. The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (11) (12) (13) recently analyzed realistic scenarios of each approach to show how they could influence morbidity and mortality trends and the impact on health services. The objective of the present study is to emphasize how strategic lowering of the reproduction number is central to a rational management plan to minimize the impacts of COVID-19.",

The first would be adopted by communities that either initially decided not (or did, but were unable) to sufficiently control the exponential increase of new cases. These 'suppression measures' reduce the reproduction number sufficiently below 1 and in so doing lower the number of infectious cases to a manageable level. The second tactic -'mitigation measures' -may either be gradually introduced towards the end of suppression, or as a preventive approach, whereby communities begin to manage very early in the outbreak.

Communities with more than 100,000 infectious cases essentially have to reduce transmission to zero in order to have about 100 cases after 60 days. Second, the duration of suppression measures to attain an objective, decreases to some extent with the severity of measures. Lowering RS to or below 0.1 (i.e., a 96+% drop from R0=2.5) from just over 10,000 infectious cases, would meet the objective of 100 after 30 days, and this indeed what was the Chinese data would suggest (1), indicating that they succeeded in lowering their RS to less than 0.1. According to these simulations, an RS>0.5 would require more than 60 days to meet this same objective. Third, epidemic management is most effective if engaged when infectious cases are low enough to preserve the capacities of health services, which, as above, is best done either near the start of an epidemic or once a suppression reset has succeeded. Although in this scenario, RM<1 is a sufficient condition for successful management, tactics that give weight to individual freedoms, yet keep RM above, but sufficiently close to 1 can successfully contain epidemic consequences, such as morbidities and mortalities and the saturation of health service capacities. Recent data analysis of 11 European countries (13) supports the basic quantitative predictions set out in the present study, and similar analyses of richer, near-future data sets will be needed to refine target parameter values so as to yield regional epidemic and global pandemic management objectives.",

A number of tactics have been proposed and some variously adopted by different communities, including: spatial distancing, quarantining, hand washing, wearing masks, gloves; diagnostics such as contact tracing, and virus and antibody testing; and interventions such as employing repurposed drugs and developing vaccines. Such approaches will need to be employed in a complementary way, since no single one on its own is likely to attain reset or management objectives. Moreover, calibration of RM in particular will require accurate assessments of the contribution of asymptomatic transmission to the propagation of the virus, the latter having been recently demonstrated in mathematical models to potentially influence COVID-19 dynamics (20) .",
