Most of these cases had a travel history to northern Italy or had been in close (household) contact with a laboratory-confirmed case. For 15 of the 128 cases the source of infection had not been determined. For seven of the 35 cases in the province of Noord-Brabant, the source of infection could not be established. Some cases elsewhere in the Netherlands were also linked to Noord-Brabant. Furthermore, in hospital B in Breda, which has offered low-threshold testing for employees with respiratory complaints since 2 March 2020, several healthcare workers (HCW) had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On Friday 6 March, the Dutch National Outbreak Management Team (OMT) convened to discuss the situation of coronavirus disease in the Netherlands. The OMT decided that an urgent assessment of possible community transmission in the province of Noord-Brabant was needed.",

Four hospitals had no systematic sampling policy for HCW but were testing all patients that presented at the emergency ward with respiratory complaints. In addition, two hospitals just outside Noord-Brabant with a large proportion of staff residing in the affected province participated in the assessment (Figure) . The participating hospitals were asked to offer screening to HCW and share the results of the testing by 14:00 on Monday 9 March 2020. Upper respiratory tract specimens (throat and/or nasopharyngeal swab) were collected from HCW with mild respiratory complaints and without epidemiological link. Testing followed a uniform national protocol based on Corman et al. [3] , that was rolled out by two central laboratories in the Netherlands.

Fatal outcome was reported in the largest study from China to be 2,3% [5] .

The study supported the implemented mitigation policy that was advised by the OMT on 6 March in anticipation of the results of the assessment [7] . The additional measures undertaken by regional authorities involved requesting inhabitants of Noord-Brabant to practice self-isolation at home when they developed a cough, symptoms of common cold and/or a fever. Furthermore, a ban of public events involving more than 1,000 people was implemented in this province [8] . As the epidemiological situation developed, on 12 March 2020, self-isolation upon mild respiratory symptoms was implemented for the whole country, together with a ban of events with more than 100 people [9] .

Nevertheless, data provided by the World Health Organization-China joint mission on COVID-19, support our approach. The mission report indicated that there were 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 among HCW from 476 hospitals in China. Close investigation into these cases revealed that most of them could be traced back to exposure in households rather than in a healthcare setting [10] .",
