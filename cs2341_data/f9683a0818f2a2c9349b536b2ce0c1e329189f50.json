Iran is now fighting COVID-19 with all its might, but the wide spread of the disease in all the provinces of the country has made it extremely difficult to control, and Iran has required assistance from international organizations such as the World Health Organization.

To effectively fight this serious disease, the government should take more stringent measures to significantly limit travel instead of simply advising citizens to stay at home.",
