As the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) outbreak spreads [2] , ICUs outside of China need to prepare for a potential surge of critically ill patients and counter the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Liu et al. have described their important preparations [4] , and we would like to expand on their good advice by sharing lessons learnt from our early experience.",

First, infection control not only involved strict adherence to personal protective equipment for the individual, but also involved changes in group dynamics. We organized our ICU to mitigate the effects of any infected staff by avoiding poten-tial spread between teams (see Table 1 ). Related to infection control, the medical ICU was given the task to cohort suspect or confirmed cases, including with peri-and postpartum care of pregnant women. Second, evolving information necessitated rapid and regular communications with large, disparate groups of clinicians.",

Given that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe viral pneumonia is well-established [5] , we prepared to cohort all COVID-19 patients in the medical ICU and have a satellite team from the cardiothoracic ICU manage the ECMO circuit. Lastly, we realized staff morale took an early hit due to multiple factors, including increased workload due to implementation of strict infection control measures, uncertainty over the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, anxiety over the lethality of any infection, concern for the well-being of their family members and stigmatization by members of the public.",
