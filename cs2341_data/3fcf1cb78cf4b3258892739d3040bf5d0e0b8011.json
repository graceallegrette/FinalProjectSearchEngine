Despite it being known that certain mammalian cell phases are arrested by PEDV, the mechanisms have not been elucidated, and PEDV pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study determined the effect of an epidemic PEDV strain on cell cycle progression. Material and Methods: We observed the effect of the PEDV SHpd/2012 strain on an infected Vero cell cycle through flow cytometry and Western blot, investigating the interrelationships of cell-cycle arrest, the DNA damage-signalling pathway caused by PEDV and the phosphorylation levels of the key molecules Chk.2 and H2A.X involved upstream and downstream in this pathway. Results: PEDV induced Vero cell-cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase. The phosphorylation levels of Chk.2 and H2A.X increased with the prolongation of PEDV infection, and no significant cell-cycle arrest was observed after treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. The proliferation of PEDV was also inhibited by treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. Conclusion: PEDV-induced cell-cycle arrest is associated with activation of DNA damage-signalling pathways. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis of PEDV replication and provide evidence to support further evaluation of PEDV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the pathogen responsible for porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). PED causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss, especially among neonatal piglets, and the morbidity and mortality of PED in neonatal piglets can reach 90%-100%. PEDV first appeared in England (21) and Belgium (15) in the early 1970s, and outbreaks later occurred in the Czech Republic, China, Korea, Vietnam, and the United States. Since 2010, new mutant strains of PEDV have been discovered in China (4, 8, 12-17, 29, 30) . These strains spread to the United States, South Korea, and southeast Asia and caused significant economic losses to the pig industry. The pathogenesis of PEDV is not clear, and the mechanism for infection of cells by PEDV remains largely unknown. Recently, PEDV infection has been shown to cause S-phase arrest of porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) (24, 25) . In a study of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), it was also found that PEDV can cause S-phase arrest of ST cells (2) . Furthermore, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and other coronaviruses can cause G0/G1-or G2/M-phase arrest (3, 7, 19, (26) (27) (28) . Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which epidemic strains of PEDV affect the mammalian cell cycle have not been elucidated. In this study, Vero cells were infected with the epidemic SHpd/2012 PEDV strain to determine the effect on cell cycle progression, to explore the molecular mechanisms producing the effects of PEDV on the cell cycle, and to provide theoretical support for a better definition of the pathogenesis of PEDV.",

The intact cell population was identified based on the forward scattersideways scatter diagram of each sample, and the middle of the cell grouping with a relatively concentrated central region was identified as R1. From the R1 population, PI intensity was plotted on the X axis (red channel), and BrdU (FITC, green channel) was plotted on the Y axis to present the periodic distribution scatter of double staining for cell cycle analysis. The S (R3), G1/G0 (R2), and G2/M (R4) phase cells were distinguished based on the intensity of the FITC fluorescence signal, and cells in the G1/G0 or G2/M phases were discriminated according to the intensity of the PI fluorescence signal; the proportion of cells in each phase was determined for the R1 population.",

Similarly, SARS-CoV protein 7a had the same impact on cyclin D3 and Rb, and the 44-82 amino acid region of the ORF 7a gene may be involved in this function (27) . Eukaryotic expression of EGFP-tagged 3b protein in Vero, HEK-293 and COS-7 cell lines has been found to block the G1/G0 phase of host cells. In addition, the N protein of SARS-CoV also plays a role in arresting the host cell cycle (18) , by binding to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex to inhibit the synthesis of genomic DNA (blocking the S phase). Further studies confirmed that the N protein could also bind to cyclin D directly, inhibit the activity of the Cdk4-cyclin D complex, and downregulate the expression of Cdk2 and the activity of the Cdk2 complex. Additionally, the downregulation of E2F1 was also observed in Vero E6 cells transfected with the N protein (18) .",

By upregulating the phosphorylation level of p53, MHV p28 protein can increase the transcriptional activity of p21 Cip1 so as to inhibit the activity of the Cdk2-cyclin E complex. Ultimately, MHV p28 protein can inhibit the phosphorylation of the Rb protein, making a large number of cells at the G1/G0 phase.",

Furthermore, by adding the inhibitor of the p53 molecule, it was found that such inhibitory effect would weaken the cycle-arrest effect of TGEV infection on ST and PK-15 cells, thus leading to speculation that TGEV infection activates the signal pathway of the p53 molecule, on the activation of which depends the cycle-arrest phenomenon (1) .",
