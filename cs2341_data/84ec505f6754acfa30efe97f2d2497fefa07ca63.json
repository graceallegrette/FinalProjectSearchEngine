It is important to ensure the ability of surgeons and specialized professionals to function through the pandemic. A conscious effort should be made to minimize infection in this sector. A high mortality rate within this group would be detrimental. This manuscript is the result of a collaboration between the major Italian surgical and anesthesiologic societies: ACOI, SIC, SICUT, SICO, SICG, SIFIPAC, SICE, and SIAARTI. We aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical care. All hospitals should organize dedicated protocols and workforce training as part of the effort to face the current pandemic.",

During MCIs, preserving financial and human resources is crucial. A good organization and a preventive approach are mandatory in the phase of MCI response called mitigation. In order to minimize resource exhaustion, the use of surgical appliances and staff must be well pondered and balanced [2] . Surgeons and sub-specialized workers in general are a valuable resource during MCI. Infection or death of sub-specialized staff must be minimized to preserve the ability to face surgical emergencies and associated activities that will continue to occur or perhaps increase during MCI. In fact, any lack of specialized teams occurring during a pandemic cannot be easily addressed by reintegrating retirees or replenishing the ranks with new staff, which would also be inevitably associated with a lowered standard of care, hence, the requirement to skeletonize surgical activities during a pandemic. When possible, all surgical procedures on all suspected COVID-19 patient should be postponed until confirmed infection clearance. Minimal staff should be involved when deferral is not possible. If a large number of senior surgeons is exposed to infected patients, the possibility for them to become infected and require self-isolation is real and could potentially result in a dangerous shortage of senior expertise within surgical teams. Resource usage should be carefully considered when planning scheduled procedures, particularly with regard to materials, staff, devices, intensive care beds, blood components, etc. Caring for resource-intensive patients might be controversial during MCIs.",

All precautionary measures apply to the use of the stretcher and to the personnel responsible for the transfer ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) both during and after transport is completed, with immediate sanitization required (Tables 2 and 3 ). Utilized lifts must be sanitized. If any unexpected contamination occurs during transport (i.e., patient vomiting or else), adequate dedicated sanitization should take place.

If available, a closed suction system should be preferred during airway aspiration. Disposable covers should be used whenever possible to reduce equipment contamination.

In order to reduce aerosolization risks, the gas flow should be turned off and the endotracheal tube clamped with forceps when switching from the portable device to the OR ventilator [4] .

Invasive procedures like for example the placement of intercostal catheters, central venous catheters, or similar should be performed at the patient's bedside, rather than in the OR. When a general anesthetic is required, a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter should be connected to the patient end of the breathing circuit and another one between the expiratory limb and the anesthetic machine [2, 6] . Alternatively, for pediatric patients or other patients in whom additional dead space or the weight of the filter may be problematic, the HEPA filter must be placed at the expiratory end of the circuit (before the exhalation re-enters the ventilator). The gas sampling tube must also be protected by a HEPA filter. Both HEPA filters and soda lime must be changed after each case [4] .

Reusable materials should be decontaminated, washed, dried, and or disinfected/sterilized, based on the likelihood of infection. Electromedical equipment (i.e., ventilator, radiological equipment) must be cleaned with chloro-derivate solution, rinsed and dried, and then disinfected with chloroderivate solution in a concentration \u2265 0.1% or 1000 ppm (parts per million) with contact time superior to 1 min [8, 9] (Table 2) . Full PPE must be worn during the sanitizing procedure. Disposable materials only (i.e., double gloves, paper towel) should be used for cleaning. Anything disposable kept inside the OR during the operation must be disposed of through IRHW containers, even if not used.",
