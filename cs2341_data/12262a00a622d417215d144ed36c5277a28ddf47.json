Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and is propelled into the low pressure vascular beds of the lungs by the right ventricle. Oxygenated pulmonary blood enters the left atrium and then to the left ventricle, which propels blood across the body at systemic vascular pressures. Right and left chambers are separated by the atrial and interventricular septa and unidirectional flow is established by the atrio-ventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) and ventricular-arterial valves (pulmonary and aortic). The heart contains an intrinsic electrophysiologic system, composed of the sinoatrial node in the right atria where depolarization begins and spreads to the atrioventricular node located at the top of the interventricular septum. This electrical impulse is then rapidly propagated by Purkinje fibers to the apex where contraction begins.",

Bulk RNA-seq analysis is unable to assign gene expression to defined cell subpopulations, light microscopy fails to define features beyond morphology of cell subpopulations and immunostainings are limited to the analysis of few markers at once. Moreover, the large size of cardiomyocytes (length/width:~100/25\u00b5M) limits the unbiased capture of single cells requiring analyses of single nuclei transcriptomics to ensure a comprehensive approach. Here, we present a broad transcriptomic census of multiple regions of the adult human heart. We profiled RNA expression of both single cells and nuclei, capturing them from six distinct cardiac anatomical regions. We also analysed the spatial distribution of selected cell populations using multiplex smFISH imaging with RNAscope probes. Our anatomically defined resolved adult human heart cell census provides a reference framework for studies directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular drivers that enable functional plasticity in response to varying physiological conditions in the normal heart, and will inform the heart's responses to disease.",

Single nuclei were isolated from frozen heart tissues and purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting. The transcriptome of single cells and nuclei were profiled using the 10X Genomics Single Cell Gene Expression Solution ( Figure 1A ).

We validated these findings using in situ smFISH with RNAscope probes ( Figure 2G FB in atrial and ventricular tissues exhibited different transcriptional profiles and subpopulations, suggesting distinct functions. We found that ECM-producing and -organising fibroblasts, while present in atria and ventricles, differed in their mode of action, as exemplified by regional-specific expression of different collagen and ECM remodelling factor genes. Together with differences in the frequency of other cell types, we suggest that region-specific FB heterogeneity is critical to support CM across varying biophysical stimuli.",

Indeed, in this study EC nuclei constituted 10.8% (atria) and 7.2% (ventricle) of cells, while immunohistochemistry data estimate that EC comprises >60% of non-myocytes in the heart 84 . By sequencing single cells and single nuclei from the same sample, we resolved seven populations including arterial, venous and lymphatic EC, and an atrial-enriched population. Using CellPhoneDB.org 85 A further cell compartment captured and analysed in depth were CD45+ immune cells. Due to their low frequency in tissues, the immune compartment is difficult to resolve using only nuclei. By performing CD45+ enrichment from the same cellular suspensions used for non-myocyte scRNA-Seq and using variational autoencoders, we identified 17 different immune cell populations across the myeloid and lymphoid lineages ( Figure 4A and 4B ).",

Related corona viral infections (SARS and MERS) also had cardiac involvement. Here, we found that expression of the viral receptor ACE2 is higher in pericytes than in CM, as previously reported 87 , but also that neither pericytes nor CM express the protease that prime viral entry, TMPRSS2 . Instead CM and pericytes express CTSB and CTSL , which may also promote viral entry. ACE2 expression correlated with AGTR1",

Expression of these genes is likely to promote tissue integrity under the conditions of high ventricular pressure and strain. Clustering of vCM data identified five subpopulations ( Figure 2A ), with variable proportions in LV, AX, SP and RV, indicative of inter-chamber heterogeneity. vCM1 and vCM2 constituted the majority of CM (~70-80%). Subpopulation vCM1 comprised~60% of vCM across all left ventricular sites, but only 33% of RV ( Figure 2C, Supplementary Table B2 ). Small numbers of these nuclei were also detected in atrial tissues ( Figure 2B,D ). In contrast, vCM2 cells were enriched in RV (42%) compared to 11% in LV. We noted only small differences (<3-fold) in the low level of expression of some genes found in vCM1 and vCM2 ( Supplementary Table B1 ), which indicates shared gene programs between the left (enriched in vCM1) and right (enriched in vCM2) ventricles.

Transcripts from these cells encoded prototypic atrial proteins and also low levels of molecules with recognized neural functions ( ADGRL2, CHRM2, GABRB2, NFXL1, KCNMB1 , ROBO2 ). As aCM1 had no defining gene enrichment in comparison to other aCM subpopulations, we suggest they likely represent a basal aCM gene program. aCM2 cells were more prominent in the RA than LA. Consistent with this, aCM 2 cells had the highest proportion (65%, Supplementary Table B3 ) of HAMP -positive CM. Other enriched transcripts in this subpopulation included SLIT3 , encoding the predominant developmental ligand for ROBO receptors in the heart 31 , ALDH1A2 9 and BRINP3, involved in retinoic acid signaling, and GRXCR2, a molecule that supports cilia involved in mechanosensing 32 .As noted above, aCM3 shared a remarkably similar transcriptional profile with vCM3including the smooth muscle cell gene CNN1 , which we confirmed by smFISH with RNAscope probes( Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure B1A).

Vascular cells of the heart The vascular cellular compartment including EC, SMC, PC,analysed alongside mesothelial cells, separated into 15 different cell populations with clear anatomical and arterio-venous specificities ( Figure 3A ). Single cell RNA-seq were particularly useful here, in addition to single nuclei, providing half of the transcriptional data ( Supplementary Table C1 ) and enabling analyses of putative (trans)differentiation relationships using RNA velocity ( Supplementary Figure C1 ). Endothelial cells, defined by pan-EC markers PECAM1 , CDH5 and VWF, were highly heterogeneous, consisting of eight subpopulations ( Figure 3A ). The most abundant subpopulation (53.0% of all EC) was annotated as capillary EC (EC_cap) given the enrichment of RGCC and CA4, marker genes of microvascular endothelium in CCL2 , IL6 and ICAM1 37 , as well as FOS and JUN that can be induced in a variety of situations including cellular stress. Neighbouring clusters contained an arterial endothelial subpopulation (EC_art), as confirmed by specific enrichment of SEMA3G , EFNB2 , DLL4 , and a venous endothelial subpopulation (EC_ven) expressing a well-accepted venous marker NR2F2 38 and ACKR1 ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure C2 and Supplementary Table C2 ). ACKR1 was reported to also be expressed in endothelial stalk cells in cancer 39 , EC expanding in cirrhosis 40 and the endothelium of lymphnodes' post-capillary venules 41 .

Association of GWAS hits with cardiac cell types Using summary statistics of 12 well-powered GWAS studies of cardiac traits ( Supplementary Table H ) we applied the GWAS gene set enrichment method MAGMA 82,83 to identify the most relevant cardiac cells for each trait, while removing redundant associations in conditional analyses. We found that atrial fibrillation (AF) GWAS signals were associated with gene expression profiles in vCM3, largely due to higher mean expression of CAV1, CAV2, PRRX1 and other AF-associated genes in vCM3 cells. PR interval GWAS signals were associated with aCM population aCM5, with high expression SCN5A, CAV1 , ARHGAP24 , MEIS1 , TBX5 and TTN . GWAS signals for the QRS duration were associated with specific gene expression in NC1 ( PRKCA, CEP85L, SLC35F1, SIPA1L1, KLF12, FADS2 ). Coronary artery disease (CAD) GWAS signals were associated with gene expression in a wide range of cell types (in particular SMC, FB, and EC). Similar results were also found for hypertension, in line with the disease relevance of vascular cells for both traits ( Supplementary Figure H ). Discussion :Our analyses of about half a million single cardiac cells and nuclei in six distinct cardiac regions from 14 donors significantly expand the characterisation of the heart's cellular landscape, and contribute to a reference adult human heart cell atlas. By combining scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq data with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques,",

CM were the most prevalent cardiac cells and comprised higher percentages in ventricles than atria, as well as in left ventricular tissues from women versus men. As expected, aCM and vCM shared gene programs involved in excitation-contraction coupling, but also exhibit transcriptional differences indicative of the different developmental origins of these chambers from two primordial heart fields, and the vastly distinctive hemodynamic forces within adult atria and ventricles. We identified five different vCM subpopulations and six different aCM subpopulations, with variable proportions in the left and right chambers, and gene profiles of suggestive of canonical as well as specialized functions.",
