Probes were based on genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV released by scientists from China. After the development of radiographic pneumonia, the patient was treated with remdesivir intravenously and almost all clinical symptoms resolved the following day 2 . Remdesivir ( Figure 1 ) is a nucleotide analog originally developed by Gilead as a drug against Ebola virus. Mechanistically, it inhibits RNA-dependent RNA synthetase (RdRp) with completed Phase I and/or II clinical trials 3, 4 . Therefore, Gilead has been working with China since February 2020 to conduct a phase 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 5 . The treatment was designed as 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 followed by 100 mg/day for 9 days. The study is expected to be completed by May 1, 2020 6 . In addition, other antiviral nucleotide analogs such as fapivir and ribavirin are undergoing clinical trials. Fapivir is a drug approved in Japan for flu treatment.",

Results from preliminary clinical trials show that chloroquine phosphate has promising effects on patients with COVID-19. Of note, it has been reported that chloroquine may cause adverse reactions such as ocular disorders, immune system disorders, ear and labyrinth disorders, cardiac disorders, etc. 8 , therefore precautions and further testing are needed for the safe and effective treatment in COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, a clinical trial to use lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 treatment will be launched soon in a hospital in Wuhan, China. In addition, since darunavir (trade name: Prozekal) is another protease inhibitor used for HIV treatment, a combination of darunavir and ritonavir could also be a potential treatment of COVID-19, especially since darunavir has been approved in China since 2018 for HIV treatment.",

The donated plasma with high-titer of SARS-COV-2 antibodies was confirmed without pathogens and with virus inactivation 12 . Of note, 12 to 24 hours post-treatment, the major inflammation symptoms decreased significantly with increased lymphocytes counts and blood oxygen saturation. Improved vital signs were also observed. Currently, although the exact underlying mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that the antibodies may bind the virus and prevent virus-host cell interaction, and therefore prevent infection. In addition, NK cells and other immune cells may also be involved in clearing the virus by antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the potential risks associated with plasma usage, including pathogen transmission and allergic reaction, should be considered, and therefore this strategy may only be applied for a clinical emergency following standardized procedures. On the other hand, specific immunoglobulin could be a better option for treating critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.",

On the other hand, nonneutralizing antibodies may bind the virus and activate the immune cells (mainly macrophages) to engulf and clear the virus. However, excessive activation of these non-specific immune cells may cause the release of a large number of proinflammatory factors leading to cytokine storm and sepsis-related death. Therefore, non-neutralizing antibodies play an antiviral role in the early stages but may cause lung damage at later stages. However, it usually takes an extended period of time to generate monoclonal antibodies for a new pathogen that can be used clinically. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is using VelociSuite technology with a humanized mouse immune system to rapidly develop innovative antibodies for the treatment of virus sepsis. This strategy has shown positive results in clinical trials using antibodies to treat Ebola 13 . The German company Inflarx has developed a monoclonal antibody against the human C5a molecule. By specifically binding and inhibiting C5a-mediated biological functions, including the release of neutrophil chemotaxis and intra-cellular lysozyme, the antibodies can limit excessive inflammation without inhibiting immune function. Clinical trials on this antibody are now underway in China to potentially reduce both lung damage and death caused by sepsis infection 14 .",
