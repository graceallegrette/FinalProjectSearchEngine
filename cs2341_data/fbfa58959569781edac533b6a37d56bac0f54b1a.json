It was first isolated from a monkey in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, and the first isolation of the virus from a human was also found to be in Uganda in the 1960s [3, 4] . Later, ZIKV was discovered in human populations in many countries including Sierra Leone, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India; however, it was not a major public concern at that time [3] [4] [5] . Attention to ZIKV reached a global level after an outbreak in Latin America in 2015 [2] . ZIKV can primarily spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes, especially the Aedes aegypti type [1, 2] . In addition, this virus can be transmitted through sexual contact or by an infected pregnant woman to her fetus, which may lead to microcephaly, a serious birth defect of the brain [3, [6] [7] [8] .",

Hence, HCPs need to have sufficient knowledge about the widespread infectious diseases, their symptoms, modes of transmission, and methods of prevention and treatment. Although multiple studies have been published globally on assessing the knowledge regarding ZIKV among HCPs, this study is the first of its kind to be conducted in Saudi Arabia [9, [15] [16] [17] . e purpose of our study is to assess the knowledge of HCPs regarding ZIKV in Riyadh, KSA.",

In that study, a survey was distributed to 412 participants and showed that majority of participants (61.8%) had inadequate knowledge about ZIKV infection [9] . Furthermore, a study conducted among HCPs in Indonesia showed comparable results (50%) [16] . Another study conducted among Middle Eastern practitioners in Qatar found that among 446 participants, 66% reported poor knowledge regarding ZIKV [15] . Moreover, a study surveyed practitioners from different countries revealed that the majority of participants have an inadequate knowledge regarding ZIKV [17] . However, a recent study conducted among general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia showed that 64% of them had good knowledge regarding ZIKV [18] . In addition, another recent study conducted among GPs in Indonesia showed that 66.5% of them had a good knowledge of pregnancy-related issues of ZIKV [19] . In our study, the majority of the respondents have an inadequate knowledge about ZIKV. Also, the knowledge level about ZIKV was significantly different by age; those aged 45 or more had significantly better knowledge than others. Lastly, a substantial difference in the knowledge level was observed by department, with pairwise comparisons showing significant differences in knowledge scores between all departments except for Pharmacy vs. Nutrition and Nursing vs. IM. e inadequate knowledge of ZIKV infection among HCPs can be improved by intensifying the annual awareness raising Hajj campaigns that are conducted in the hospitals and enforced by the government which aim to face and prevent infections among pilgrims. Pilgrimage is an annual gathering of people in Mecca, KSA. Around two million pilgrims come every year from various countries around the world, which may carry a risk of emergence or transmission of infectious diseases [14] . Although ZIKV infection has not been reported in KSA, there are many pilgrims who annually visit from countries in which this infection was reported, so the risk of having this infection transmitted during pilgrimage cannot be ruled out. Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus (MERS-coV) nosocomial outbreak was first reported in KSA in 2012 which derived huge governmental efforts on infection control and prevention in the past few years [20] . As a result, HCPs in KSA should be motivated to update their knowledge in the emerging infections as they just faced MERS-coV nosocomial outbreak in the country.",
