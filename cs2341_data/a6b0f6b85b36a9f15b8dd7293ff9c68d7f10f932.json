From all the cases, 1,111 had their severity classified: 14.3% were asymptomatic, 36.4% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.2% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (16.3%), followed by cough (14.4%), nasal symptoms (3.6%), diarrhea (2.7%) and nausea/vomiting (2.5%). One hundred forty-five (12.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (3.8%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count were reported in 13.1% of cases. Abnormalities on computed tomography was reported in 62.7% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations.

It was observed that only a small proportion of infected children became severely or critically ill. About half of the children with COVID-19 were asymptomatic or mild cases, and several were classified as moderate due to radiological abnormalities in spite of their mild clinical manifestations. The prognosis seems to be very good, with recovery described in the vast majority of reported cases. Only one death was reported in the included studies, a 10-month-old child with intussusception. 3 Since COVID-19 has a favorable clinical course in children, the importance of pediatric cases is mainly due to epidemiological issues. Despite being mild or asymptomatic cases, prolonged viral shedding in stool and nasal secretions made children facilitators of viral transmission. 5, 42 In the study of Xu et al., eight of ten children with SARS-CoV02 had persistently positive rectal swabs even after their nasopharyngeal tests .

The role of children in the transmission chain needs to be urgently clarified to establish social and public health policies for the protection of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and people with comorbidities. Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition is essential for clinical management and outbreak control. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The WHO, CDC and several other government health agencies emphasize fever and respiratory symptoms in the criteria for suspected cases, however, we observed in our study that only 16.3% of pediatric cases had fever. 43,44 Since many are asymptomatic or mild cases, children certainly are not tested as often as adults, leading to an underestimate of the true numbers of infected people and increased transmission of the virus. Guan et al. demonstrated pronounced lymphopenia in adults with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, where the observed prevalence was 96.1%. 4 Some authors even suggest that lymphopenia is a predictor of prognosis in adult patients with COVID-19. 45 tIn our study, decreased lymphocyte count was described in only 13.1% of infected children, in contrast with adults, in which 80% of the non-severe cases have lymphopenia.With this, lymphopenia may not be a reliable indicator of COVID-19 in children.Similarly to adults, the most prevalent abnormalities on chest CT of children with COVID-19 were ground glass opacities and patchy shadowings. However, while 86.2% of adults cases presented any abnormalities on chest CT, the same occurred in only 62.7% of children in the selected studies. Descriptions of chest x-rays of pediatric cases are scarce and would be usefull for resource-limited settings.",
