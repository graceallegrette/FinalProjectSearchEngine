Warning signs for COVID-19 infection should be posted in front of the operating room to minimize staff exposure. \u2022 Patients should not stay in the recovery room or postoperative care unit. After complete recovery in the operating room, the patient should be transferred into a negative pressure room in a ward or intensive care unit (ICU). \u2022 Endotracheal intubation, tube exchange, and extubation are high-risk procedures that can expose healthcare workers to respiratory droplets of the virus. These procedures must be carried out in a location where negative pressure is applied such as negative pressure room, and special care should be taken. \u2022 Depending on the clinical situation, performing an endotracheal intubation early in a negative pressure room in a ward or ICU, rather than in an operating room, should be considered. \u2022 If it is determined that the degree of negative pressure in the environment is not sufficient, the additional application of a portable high-efficiency particulate air filter should be considered. \u2022 A highly efficient hydrophobic filter should be placed between the endotracheal tube and the reservoir bag, to prevent atmospheric contamination by respiratory droplets during patient transfers.",
