            "text": "The spread of an epidemic disease (e.g., tuberculosis (TB), 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 Asianinfluenza, 3 swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) 4, 5 ) in a population can be studied by using dynamical system approaches. The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the susceptible-infected-recovered/removed (SIR) model are two widely considered models. The theory of complex network can provide an analytic framework for heterogenous contact patterns of a population. 6 The heterogeneous contact reflects the property that the node degree k, or, the number of contacts with other individuals for a given individual, is not uniform. The frequently used network models are Erd\u20ac os-R enyi (ER) random graphes, 7 Strogatz-Watts (SW) small-world networks, 8 and Barab asi-Albert (BA) scale-free networks. 9 There is a sharp contrast in their degree distributions P(k). The study of epidemic spreading on complex networks shows the existence of a high correlation between the condition of epidemic outbreak and the degree distribution. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] How to find optimal immunization strategies to minimize the risk of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks have been widely studied. 14-21 A number of basic immunization strategies have been proposed and investigated, such as the random immunization, 14 the targeted immunization 14 and the acquaintance immunization. 15 These proposed immunization strategies, however, are built on a major premise that vaccination or immunization is compulsory and have not considered the willingness or desire of individuals. Given some social factors, such as, religious belief and human rights, thus, the immunization behavior is not a compulsory behavior but decided by individuals themselves. In this situation, whether to vaccinate or not is related to the risk of being infected by the infectious disease. 18, 20 As a kind of individual awareness, 22, 23 risk assessment of infection should be closely related to an individual's local information (the state of an individual's neighborhood). Hence, individual vaccination behavior depends on its local information. For the convenience, we call such dynamic immunization as the responsive immunization, 21 which is also referred as the information-driven vaccination 19 or the information dependent vaccination. 24 In our work 22 and further work, 25 the local information affects individual susceptibility and can change the epidemic threshold. An interesting problem is: can the responsive immunization based on the local information affect the epidemic threshold? Intuitively, the answer seems to be \"yes.\" However, we will find that it is not the case for the responsive immunization. In this paper, we mainly focus on the influence of the responsive immunization on the \"epidemic threshold.\" Herein, the \"epidemic threshold\" means the critical value that can discriminate the dynamical behaviors of the system. 26 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, an SIS epidemic model with responsive immunization strategy is proposed and the theoretical analysis on the thresholds a)",

In our intervention model, we also find the existence of multiple critical values of spreading rate. Interestingly, the meanings of k c and k 0 c are just as stated in Ref. 26 . From the viewpoint of epidemic control, it is not enough to raise the larger threshold k 0 c because the epidemic still breaks out when the spreading rate k satisfies k c < k < k 0 c . In our model, the responsive immunization has no significant influence on the epidemic threshold and a large vaccination fraction is required to halt the epidemic spreading. It is necessary to take some intervention measures in the voluntary vaccination. We argue that there are two types of intervention measures according to their effects: (1) one is that the epidemic threshold becomes larger; (2) the other is that the epidemic threshold is unchanged but final vaccination size decreases. In the present paper, the degree-based intervention based on the targeted immunization belongs to the second type since it can only reduce the vaccine size. One may consider the first type of vaccination intervention, e.g., the responsive immunization on the adaptive contact network 17 where the epidemic threshold may be changed due to the change of network structure.",
