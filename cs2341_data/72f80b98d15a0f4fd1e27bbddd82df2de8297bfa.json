Since March 16 th , lockdown measures oriented on flattening the epidemic curve were in place in Spain, restricting social contact, reducing public transport, and closing businesses, except for those essential to the country's supply chains (3) . However, this has not been enough to change the rising trend of the epidemic. For this reason, a more restrictive lockdown was suggested (4), and eventually undertaken by the Spanish Government on March 30 th (5) .",
