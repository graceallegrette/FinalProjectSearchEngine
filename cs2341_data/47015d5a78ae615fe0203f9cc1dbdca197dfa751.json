Typically, there is never a recession on the eve of a US presidential election; adjustments and crises usually occur the following year. If that were the case, Trump would likely win again, riding on the wave of a growing economy with low unemployment, and relying on the right-oriented radicalisation of his core electorate. Now the scenario has completely changed. The ability of the United States to control the pandemic is diffi cult to assess; government actions are now catching up after the early denial of the severity of coronavirus infections. Pressed by the spreading of the pandemic and a risk of a severe recession in the US, the Trump administration has planned to launch with dangerous delays and strong divisions in Congress -a nearly 2 trillion dollar plan to shore up the economy. It includes supporting the costs of an underfunded and highly unequal healthcare system, helping fi rms, extending unemployment benefi ts and family leave, and even sending money directly to US citizens. With a 2019 US GDP of 21.2 trillion dollars, the US emergency plan amounts to about 9.5% of GDP. Still, Trump may prove to be an inadequate leader in the face of this emergency (Krugman, 2020) . There is a possibility that everything might collapse: starting with a severe drop in US and world economic growth, a fi nancial crash, Trump losing the election and the likely Democratic candidate former Vice President Joe Biden being left to restore some order in 2021. In terms of world order, a continuation of 'systemic chaos' could be expected, with the fur-ther decline of US leadership and the rising infl uence of Asia and China. 2 Europe Economies on this side of the Atlantic are facing severe diffi culties -many of them of their own making. The ECB's new plan to overcome the crisis came after days of a lack of clarity and divisions within the board. On 12 March, the fi rst ECB decision to provide new liquidity was accompanied by a disastrous statement by Lagarde: \"[W]e are not here to close spreads\", taken from a phrase by a German Member of the Executive Board of the ECB (Lagarde and de Guindos, 2020) . A major worsening of the spread in interest rates between Italian and German government bonds and a stock market fall immediately followed the statement. The President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella, with an unprecedented intervention, immediately replied that \"initiatives of solidarity and not moves that can hinder Italy's actions\" (2020) are expected from Europe, leading to a slight correction of Lagarde's view: \"I am fully committed to avoid any fragmentation in a difficult moment for the euro area\" (Lagarde and de Guindos, 2020) .",

As European economies are closely integrated in global value chains, they will probably suffer from a 'supply-chain contagion' (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro, 2020) . Major negative economic effects are associated with the loss of employment and wages, which can only be compensated to a limited extent by the muchneeded income support measures introduced by governments (guaranteed incomes, tax relief, etc.). The resulting fall in demand will further slow down production, while the increase in health expenditure is unlikely to have signifi cant expansionary effects on the economy as a whole.",

The authors renewed the proposal to introduce Euro Union Bonds, based on the experience of the European Stability Mechanism (which may already issue European securities) and on the activities of the European Investment Bank. According to Quadrio Curzio, \"[A] system with a central bank and a single currency must also have an adequate federal or confederal budget, be-tween 10% and 20% of GDP, which can be fi nanced with capital market issues\" (2020a). Quadrio Curzio also proposed the issue of a 'Euro Rescue Bond' (ERB): \"[W]ith appropriate guarantees, the ECB itself could purchase the ERBs as it has purchased government bonds of individual countries\" (2020b). Such measures -a significant expansion of the European budget, the issuance of Eurobonds that the ECB can buy directly, a rethinking of the role of the European Stability Mechanism and the European Investment Bank to fi nance European public investment -are essential for turning the European Union into a political institution capable of facing the pandemic and its economic consequences, avoiding the current paralysis and the fragmentation of national responses.",

Advances in care systems, instrumentation, biotechnologies, genetics and drug research have to be supported and regulated, considering their ethical and social consequences (as in the cases of GMOs, cloning, access to drugs in developing countries, etc.). Social innovation may spread in welfare services with a greater role of citizens, users and non-profi t organisations, renewed public provision and new forms of self-organisation of communities. (279) Such a policy can be built in Europe using existing institutions, policy tools and resources, pushing economic activities towards the protection of health and welfare and putting Europe on a sustainable path of long-term environmental transition on the basis of a green industrial policy. The welfare state and public health reduce inequalities Inequality is a major concern in this context. Since the 1980s, as a result of neoliberal policies, advanced countries have experienced sharp increases in income and wealth disparities. Because of its nature as a supplier of goods and services based on individual and social needs, the welfare state has been a key factor in reducing inequalities after the Second World War. As argued in our book Explaining inequality (Franzini and Pianta, 2015) , the reduction of the policy space, the privatisation of public services and the extension of the market in areas previously protected by public action have introduced new mechanisms that generated economic and social disparities. In Europe a report from the European Commission recalled that \"[i]n all countries with available data, significant differences in health exist between socioeconomic groups, in the sense that people with lower levels of education, occupation and/or income tend to have systematically higher morbidity and mortality rate\" (2007) . And, considering the economic effects of disparities in health conditions, the EU report calculated that the number of deaths that can be attributed to health inequalities in the European Union (EU25) as a whole is estimated to be 707,000 per year and the number of life years lost due to these death is about 11.4 million. Health inequalities also affect the average life expectancy at birth of men and women, decreasing it by 1.84 years. The total costs due to health inequalities -obtained from the combination of data relating to mortality and morbidity -is close to 980 billion euros, 9.38% of EU25 GDP in 2004. In other words, the loss of health due to socio-economic inequalities represents 15% of the costs of social security systems and 20% of the costs of health care systems in the European Union as a whole (Mackenbach, 2007). 6 The relationship between inequalities and health has been analysed in several countries by considering different social and professional conditions (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009; Costa et al., 2004) , showing that mortality rates increase in proportion to economic and social hardship, lower incomes, education and social class. Thus, reducing economic inequalities would make it possible to reduce health disparities; at the same time, greater universal and egalitarian health protection would signifi cantly reduce the costs of public health and welfare.",
