Current estimates indicate that 15% of patients with COVID-19 will develop severe disease, and 5 to 10% will require intensive care-level support. In certain scenarios, escalation of life-sustaining therapies (defined as intubation, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and/or hemodialysis) will either not be within the patient's goals of care, or will unfortunately be unsuccessful. Overall mortality risk from COVID-19 is estimated to be between 3 and 5%. 1, 2 Decision-making around goals of care should, as always, be patient-centered and addressed early in the patient's illness trajectory. Concerns around overall resource use in COVID-19 should not affect individualized decision-making in the absence of clear guidance from administrators and ethicists. As the pandemic evolves, decisions around distributive justice and resource use may become necessary; however, this document focuses on the care of the individual patient before the emergency physician (EP).",

Given that extubation is considered an aerosol generating procedure and thus can be high risk to health care workers and family members present in the room, our recommendation is to not extubate the patient in the ED, but to decrease ventilatory support and ensure comfort throughout (see Appendix). If extubation is being considered, the patient should be in a negative pressure room, and all providers should be prepared with airborne personal protective equipment. Before this, we recommend speaking with experts in Critical Care and following best practices for withdrawal of mechanical ventilation.",
