All the employees used gowns, gloves, medical masks and eye protection when providing care to all remaining patients. Among the patients who were either discharged during the suspension period or quarantined, we repeated SARS-CoV-2 PCR before discharge as there was the possibility of delayed positivity in coronavirus testing in relation to illness onset. 6 All of the repeated PCR results were negative. Those who were quarantined had terminated isolation on the day the suspension period ended. After the hospital re-opened, all of the new employees had to be tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative to enter the building.",

However concerns have been raised due to the prolonged suspension period set by the government following the old guidelines established during the MERS outbreak. 4 Many studies have shown that although human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days, it can be significantly disinfected within 1 minute exposure time using 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 62%-71% ethanol. 8 Also based on 12 air changes per hour, it takes only 30 minutes for removal efficiency of 99.9% of airborne contaminants. 9 These evidences show that revision of the current infection control guideline is inevitable. The existing patients could not receive timely treatments and some were denied care elsewhere during the shutdown period. Therefore extreme measures to close the entire hospital were considered unreasonable by many people. There were also controversial questions of the quarantine period as a majority of our patients were asymptomatic and found the days in-hospital too grueling.",
