Previous studies established the impact of population outflow from Wuhan on the spatial spread of coronavirus in China and hinted the impact of the other three mobility patterns, i.e., population outflow from Hubei province excluding Wuhan, population inflow from cities outside Hubei, and intra-city population movement. However, the overall impact of all mobility patterns, or the impact of the different timing of mobility restriction intervention, are not systematically analyzed. Here we apply the cumulative confirmed cases and mobility data of 350 Chinese cities outside Hubei to explore the relationships between all mobility patterns and epidemic spread, and estimate the impact of local travel restrictions, both in terms of level and timing, on the epidemic control based on mobility change. The relationships were identified by using Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multivariable linear regression, while scenario simulation was used to estimate the mobility change caused by local travel restrictions. Our analysis shows that: (1) all mobility patterns correlated with the spread of the coronavirus in Chinese cities outside Hubei, while the corrleations droppd with the implemetation of .

            "text": "Previous studies prove it is the population mobility that accelerates the spatial spread of the epidemic, while travel restrictions could contribute to the epidemic control. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The spring migration (\"chunyun\" in Chinese) of 2020 started on Jan 10, which is the earth's most massive annual human migration. 13 Although Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, suspended all in and out public transport since 10:00 am Jan 23, 2020, about five million people already left Wuhan before the quarantine. 14 Studies show that while the Wuhan lockdown greatly slowed the spread of COVID-19, 6-10 the number of population emigration from Wuhan highly correlated to the imported cases in other cities in China. 8, [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] While the impact of the population outflow from Wuhan is well established, the impact of other mobility patterns on the epidemic trajectory has not been well understood. Local population mobility for a city includes both intra-city and inter-city patterns. The inter-city mobility can be categorized into three sources, i.e., from Wuhan, from Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), and from cities outside Hubei. As nearly two-thirds of population outflow from Wuhan flooded into other cities within the Hubei Province, 13, 17 it is important to consider the population outflow from Hubei (excluding Wuhan) as a potentially most significant source of epidemic transmission risk after Jan 23. The intra-city population movement is also an essential factor-research shows that cities introduced pre-emptive intra-city movement restrictions have 33.3% less confirmed cases in the first week of the epidemic outbreak compared to those started restrictions after the emerging of confirmed cases, 6 pointing to the importance of timing of introducing these measures. For inter-city population movement among cities outside Hubei, which are restricted after the Wuhan lockdown, different studies hold inconsistent reviews. On the one hand, the implementation of inter-city travel restrictions cannot significantly reduce the number of confirmed cases during the first week of city outbreaks; 6 on the other hand, the transmission model of the COVID-19 cannot be accurately established without the inter-city connections. 19 Most of these existing studies are based on one or two mobility patterns, and the overall impact of these four mobility patterns on the spread of the COVID-19 is not well understood. The uncertainty of the number of confirmed cases in the early stage of the epidemic spread, 5, 19 ranging from 427 (officially confirmed) to potentially over 10,000 underscores the importance of considering all four mobility patterns in the COVID-19 spread, perhaps more so than the number of confirmed cases. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between population mobility, both inter-city and intra-city, and the spread of COVID-19. Based on the mobility change, the impact of local travel restrictions in other cities, besides the Wuhan lockdown, on the epidemic control was estimated. Given that the three mobility patterns, except the population outflow from Wuhan, are heavily influenced by policy measures introduced by the central and local governments, such investigate is important in evaluating the effectiveness and understanding the influence of timing of different measures, which can in turn inform policy interventions in the future.",

Meanwhile, the inter-city population movement from cities outside Hubei and intra-city population movement have varied impact. For cities without initial confirmed cases, both inter-city and intra-city population movements significantly influenced the epidemic development. In other words, four kinds of mobility patterns jointly affected the epidemic spread in these cities. For cities with initial confirmed ones, both inter-city (from cities outside Hubei) and intra-city population movement have no significant impact on their epidemic development. Two reasons might cause it. One is that the directly imported cases from Hubei took the majority of reported ones in this stage, namely the significance of population inflow from Hubei subjugating others. The cities with initial confirmed cases are the leading destinations for population outflow from Hubei. These cities, taking 32.6% of cities outside Hubei, accommodated 57.9% of population outflow from Wuhan before its closure and 68.1% of population outflow from Hubei excluding Wuhan after the Wuhan lockdown.

The travel controls in cities without initial confirmed cases tend to be relatively late or loose than those in cities having initial infections. From Jan 24 to Jan 30, 2020, the inter-city population movement from cities outside Hubei and intra-city population movement in cities without initial confirmed cases decreased on average to 64.4% and 72.6% of those in the same period of 2019, while the percentage are averagely 59.2% and 65.2% for cities with initial confirmed cases ( Table   .

Our results show, in the early stage of epidemic development, it is the inter-city mobility, including from Wuhan, from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and from other cities outside Hubei, that promotes the spatial spread of the virus. After the quarantine of the whole Hubei and the prohibition of inter-city transport, the importance of restricting the intra-city population movement is highlighted. If there were no restrictions on intra-city population movement, the confirmed cases in cities outside Hubei might increase 33.1% (95%PI: 19.3%-46.9%) in the third and fourth weeks after the Wuhan lockdown.

First, the geographical extension of the quarantine should be carefully considered by the government before the official announcement. In the early stage of epidemic development, there might be a nonnegligible number of infected but undetected people in the areas that have geographical connections and frequent traffic with the epidemic-stricken ones, like other cities in Hubei. In particular, there are many asymptomatic virus careers that are highly contagious. 23, 28 On the other hand, the expansion of the quarantined area would also bring substantial economic losses. Whether to include farther hinterlands, and if so to what extent, will need to be carefully considered carefully in making the quarantine decision.",

Moreover, in Stage Two that local travel bans have been fully implemented, cities with a larger number of inter-city and intra-city population movements would have more local infections.The correlation coefficients between the same mobility pattern and the number of confirmed cases are different in Stage One and Stage Two. In Stage One, the coefficients between the number of population inflow from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei and the number of confirmed cases (r=0.717 and 0.739 respectively, p<0.01) are higher than those of population migration from cities outside Hubei and intracity population movement (r=0.650 and 0.597 respectively, p<0.01), indicating the leading role of imported cases in this time period. In Stage Two, the correlations between mobility patterns and the number of confirmed cases (r<0.5, p<0.01) weaken compared to those in Stage One (r>0.55, p<0.01), suggesting the effects of mobility on epidemic spread might be reduced due to local travel restrictions.Meanwhile, the relationship between population migration from cities outside Hubei and intra-city population movement changes from highly correlated (r=0.812, p<0.01) to moderately correlated (r=0.485, p<0.01), implying the different strictness of inter-city and intra-city travel bans.",

Although these travel restrictions have reduced the number of confirmed cases in cities outside Hubei by around 15% of observed ones in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, another 10.5% might be prevented by a more timely quarantine of the whole Hubei province. This highlights the importance of timely and coordinated response across localities in epidemic mitigation.For cities with and without initial confirmed cases by the time of Wuhan lockdown, their local epidemics might be dominated by different population mobility patterns. Most cities reporting confirmed cases before the Wuhan shutdown are the leading destinations for population outflow from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei. Cutting off their inter-provincial traffic from Hubei could protect them to a great extent.",
