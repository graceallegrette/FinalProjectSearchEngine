We found that heating (<100 \u00b0C) under various humidities (up to 100% RH at 75 \u00b0C) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were the most promising candidates for mask reuse in the modern hospital infrastructure (up to 20 cycles), when tested on a fabric with particle filtration efficiency \u226595%.

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in Wuhan, China [2] [3] [4] [5] . The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin, sharing 96% of its genome with the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG13, and like the SARS-CoV, enters human cells via the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a membrane protein that is an entry point for coronaviruses found in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestines that is responsible for regulating vasoconstriction and blood pressure. It was found that the SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV, which may explain why the human-to-human transmissibility of the virus is so high 6, 7 .",

            "text": "While the exact mode SARS-CoV-2's viral transmission is not known, a primary mode in viruses such as SARS and influenza is known to be through short-range aerosols and droplets 13, 14 . When a person infected with a virus breathes, speaks, sings, coughs, or sneezes micron sized aerosols containing the virus are released into the air. Data gathered from influenza patients suggest that these aerosols are typically fine (<5 \u03bcm, at times <1 \u03bcm) or coarse (>5 \u03bcm) [14] [15] [16] . For these coarse particles, they can typically settle due to gravity within an hour. However, fine particles, especially smaller than 1 \u03bcm can essentially stay nearly indefinitely in the air. As particles >10 \u03bcm settle very rapidly, these droplets are not typically deposited in the respiratory tract through means of aerosol inhalation. Particles >5 \u03bcm typically will only reach the upper respiratory tract, and fine particles <5 \u03bcm are critically able to reach the lower respiratory tract, similar to harmful particulate matter pollution ( Figure 1 ). While it is commonly believed that coughing and sneezing provide the most likely airborne vector, the size distribution and number of particles emitted during in normal speech serve as a significant viral transmitter 15 . Singing has been found to be comparable to continuous coughing in the transmission of airborne pathogens 17 . Anecdotal support of this finding was unfortunately demonstrated during a choir practice on March 10, 2020 in Washington State. Although the choir members did not touch each other or share music during the rehearsal, 45 out of the 60 members of the Skagit Valley Choir were diagnosed with the virus three weeks later, and two have deceased. For dangerous airborne particulates, including viral aerosols during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the usage of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) as personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals [18] [19] [20] . The N95 grade is determined by the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (document 42 CFR Part 84) which designates a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for 0.3 \u03bcm (aerodynamic mass median diameter) of sodium chloride aerosols. In addition to N95, there are N99 and N100 which correspond to filtration efficiencies of 99% and 99.97%, respectively. For oil-based aerosols (DOP), NIOSH also has created grades R and P (with filtration efficiencies 95-99.97%). Elsewhere around the globe, the equivalent filtration grades to N95 are FFP2 (European Union), KN95 (China), DS/DL2 (Japan), and KF94 (South Korea). While the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus is around 150 nm 21 , commonly found N95 respirators can offer protection against particles as small as 80 nm 22 with 95% filtration efficiency (initial testing, not loaded). With the actual viral aerosols in the ~1 \u03bcm range, the N95 FFRs' filtration efficiency should be sufficient for personal protection.",

Though the virus will eventually become inactive on the mask surface and it is unlikely to fully penetrate to the user's intake side, a recent study shows that it required 72 hours for the concentration of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses on plastic surfaces (40% RH and 21-23 \u00b0C) to be reduced by 3 orders of magnitude (from 10 3.7 to 10 0.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium) 30 . Assuming a similar longevity on FFR surfaces, it is important to develop procedures for the safe and frequent re-use of FFRs without reducing the filtration efficiency. The CDC has recommended many disinfection or sterilization methods, typically involving chemical, radiative, or temperature treatments 31 . In brief, we can summarize the mechanism of disinfection or sterilization of bacteria and viruses as among the following: protein denaturation (alcohols, heat), DNA/RNA disruption (UV, peroxides, oxidizers), cellular disruption (phenolics, chlorides, aldehydes). While none of these methods have been extensively evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation specifically, we tested methods that can be easily deployed within a hospital setting with relatively high throughput for FFR reuse.",

We applied these treatments (see methods for details) to a meltblown fabric (20 g/m 2 ) that has an initial efficiency of \u226595%, which may be integrated into N95 FFRs. We evaluated the filtration efficiency and pressure drop of these treated fabrics via industry standard equipment, Automated Filter Tester 8130A (TSI), with a flow rate of 32 L/min. A change in the filtration efficiency of the meltblown fabric can result from physical damage or static charge degradation, while a pressure drop change would suggest that the porosity or degree of loftiness has been altered.",

Microwaving was not considered as many facemasks contain metals which may spark and melt the FFR. From the first disinfection, we can clearly note that the solution-based methods (ethanol and chlorine-based solution) drastically degraded the filtration efficiency while the pressure drop remained comparable. This most likely indicates that the physical structure of the filters was not altered (Supplementary Figure S1 ), but the quasi-permanent polarization state of the electret may be altered. It is hypothesized in the literature that small molecules such as solvents can permeate into the fabric and liberate the charge traps or frozen charges of the electret 35 . The chlorine-based solution may also degrade the efficiency less than the alcoholbased solution due to the higher water content. As polypropylene is hydrophobic, the chlorinebased solution may have a more difficult time in the penetration into the fabric and the static charge of fibers deeper within the meltblown may be less affected. This is also potentially a source of concern for the steam treatment, as the dwelling time and frequency may be critical for .

If further steam treatments saturate the fibers many times and can condense water droplets on the fibers, it is possible that the static charge can also be slowly decayed in this method. These initial results are mostly in agreement with a NIOSH published report regarding the decontamination of whole FFRs 36 , though it focused more on gas-based methods, which could be suitable to well-controlled industrial scale disinfection. However, this may not be practical for on-site disinfection within the current hospital and clinic infrastructure.

This degradation is most likely due to the aforementioned water saturation. The data of these cycles is provided in Supplementary Table S2 . Thus, we believe that steam treatment may be effective with certain precautions.

Up to 100 \u00b0C, there is little to no change in the filtration efficiency and pressure drop. However, at 125 \u00b0C, there is a sharp drop in the filtration efficiency while maintaining a constant pressure drop at around cycle 5. As the pressure drop was unchanged, this suggests that the filtration decrease is also a result of the depolarization of some static charge, similar to alcohol immersion. Considering the higher temperature, polypropylene's melting point (130-170 \u00b0C), as well as the thin and fibrous nature of the media, it is possible that the higher temperature is enough to relax the microscopic charge state within the polymer resulting in some of the quasi-stable polarization to become depolarized to their neutral state. From SEM images, we did not identify any morphological changes and did not observe any apparent physical deformations (Supplementary Figure S2) , which may support this conclusion. It is clear that this effect is not as strong as direct solvent contact, which reduced the filtration efficiency to <80%. The mechanism of which may differ, as the solvent can liberate charge traps, but the temperature here provides energy to return some of the fibers' polarized state to a relaxed state.",

            "text": "While UV radiation may possess enough energy to break the chemical bonds and degrade polypropylene, the dosage of the sterilization chamber is relatively low, and the material degrades very slowly. This is supported by previous experiments that showed UV-C doses up to 950 J/cm 2 did not appreciably change the filtration efficiency. A possible concern regarding UVGI disinfection for FFRs is of the UV penetration depth. As UV-C has a wavelength around 250 nm, and polypropylene is a UV absorber, it is difficult to conclude if smaller viral particles deep within the filter can be deactivated through UVGI. If the particles are all of a larger size and remain localized on the surface, UVGI may be a candidate for FFR reuse. Furthermore, this means that UVGI requires FFRs to not be stacked, as the incident radiation is will only be absorbed by the top-most surface. Another disadvantage is that UVGI was reported to significantly impact the mechanical strength of some FFRs with doses of around 1000 J/cm 2, 38 . Therefore, UVGI may be a useful disinfection technique, but the precise dosage and intensity of the UV-C light fluence on the mask surface would need to be verified. The variation in UVGI intensity has been the cause of discrepancies in the literature, as 3M's own internal reports recently showed that their UVGI treatments damaged particular FFRs 39 , whereas other reports show that UVGI cycling on multiple N95 FFRs had minimal or no impact 37 .",

However, as actually donning and using the respirator impacts the structural stability of such components, particular care needs to be taken in interpretation of these results. Previous reports also indicated that FFRs can safely be donned up to five times, but beyond five times may result in a less than adequate fit 40 .

The current shortage of N95 FFRs during this time of rapidly spreading infection may be mitigated by methods that will allow the safe reuse. We have tested methods which may be suitable for the re-use of particulate respirators, and hope our results will be useful in helping hospitals and other health care facilities in formulating safe standard operating procedures (SOPs) so that virus inactivation is assured while not compromising mask protection. While we reiterate that these methods have not been tested on SARS-CoV-2 directly for inactivation, these methods use precedents set by either SARS-CoV or general disinfection strategies. We found that of commonly deployable methods, heating (dry or in the presence humidity) <100 \u00b0C can preserve the filtration characteristics of a pristine N95 respirator. The UVGI (254 nm, 17 mW/cm 2 ) sterilizer cabinet used in these tests does not have enough dose to damage the respirators within a reasonable number of treatment cycles and may be considered for disinfection, with doses smaller than 1000 J/cm 2 . Using steam to disinfect requires caution, as the treatments may seem to be suitable, but prolonged treatment may leave the user with unsuitable protection. Finally, we advise against using certain liquid contact, such as alcohol solutions, chlorine-based solutions, or soaps to clean the respirator, as this will lead to a degradation in the static charge that is necessary for the FFR to meet the N95 standard.",
