Drawing from this data, Patel and colleagues utilized TPE during the 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in three pediatric patients presenting in a similar fashion to those seen with fulminant COVID-19 today [12] . All three patients developed ARDS with hemodynamic compromise that continued to deteriorate despite standard care and rescue therapy for ARDS including inhaled nitric oxide (3/3) and veno-venous ECMO (1/3). Predicted mortality was high, but all three had full recovery from their illness after receiving rescue TPE.",

Our group has recently submitted the results of our single-center experience with TPE in sepsis with multiple organ failure with the manuscript currently under consideration for publication with preprint available online (DOI: https://doi.org/ 10.21203/rs.3.rs-16022/v1) [13] . In our trial, charts were retrospectively reviewed and patients receiving adjunct TPE were propensity matched to patients with similar illness who received standard of care alone. Full details are available online, but it should be noted that all patients required \u2265 2 vasopressors and all patients receiving TPE required mechanical ventilator support. Nearly half of the patients in both groups (39/80) presented with pneumonia as the primary source of infection, and a subgroup analysis showed the greatest mortality benefit with TPE in these patients (47.8% mortality vs. 81.3% mortality, p = 0.05). While a singlecenter, retrospective trial is obviously limited, the results are very encouraging and support the need for further investigation, particularly in today's environment with increasing incidence of COVID-19. Our practice has changed based on our experience, and we now often utilize TPE earlier in the clinical course of septic shock with MODS and ARDS rather than as \"rescue therapy.\" Anecdotally, the results have been remarkable but have not been reviewed or statistically analyzed.",

The uncertainties of the disease are frightening, but it is likely that the host response to coronavirus is the same as that seen in other infections. Presently, treatment for sepsis and ARDS centers on early antimicrobials, source control, and \"supportive care.\" This outbreak should serve as impetus to investigate therapies targeting the pathways that lead to the morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes. Therapeutic plasma exchange shows promise, and we propose that randomized trials be designed to investigate further. ",
