Viral RNA quantification was performed at 7 sampling days post-laboratory inoculation (d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42) and infectivity was assessed via bioassay with 10-d-old pigs. There was a tendency for treatment \u00d7 feed matrix \u00d7 day interaction (P = 0.094), in which the cycle threshold (Ct) value increased over time in FEED when treated with both feed additives, whereas there was no increase over time observed in SDPP treated with both feed additives. There was a feed matrix \u00d7 day interaction (P < 0.001) in which Ct increased over time in FEED, whereas very little increase over time was observed in SDPP. A tendency for a treatment \u00d7 feed matrix effect (P = 0.085) was observed where FEED treated with the combination of EO and BA had a greater (P < 0.05) PEDV Ct value than other FEED treatments, and all SDPP treatments had the lower PEDV Ct values compared to FEED treatments (P < 0.05). Overall, the combination of both feed additives was most effective at reducing the quantity of genetic material as detected by qRT-PCR (P < 0.001) compared to either additive alone or no feed additive. Virus shedding was observed in the d 7 postinoculation SDPP treatment that was treated with both feed additives, as well as d 0 untreated FEED and d 0 FEED treated with both feed additives. No other treatment bioassay room had detectible RNA shed and detected in fecal swabs or cecal contents. In summary, the combination of EO and BA enhanced the degradation of PEDV RNA in feed but had little impact on RNA degradation in SDPP. Both untreated feed and feed treated with the combination of EO and BA resulted in infection at d 0 post-laboratory inoculation; however, neither set of samples was infective at d 1 postinoculation. In addition, SDPP harbored greater levels of quantifiable RNA for a longer duration of time compared to FEED, and these viral particles remained viable for a longer duration of time indicating differences in viral stability exist between different feed matrices.",

Therefore, potential strategies to mitigate the risk of disease transmission via feed and feed ingredients would be valuable to the swine and feed-manufacturing industries. Research assessing potential mitigation techniques has primarily included two approaches: point-in-time mitigation strategies and mitigation strategies with a prolonged duration of effect. Point-in-time mitigation strategies, such as use of thermal processing or irradiation (Trudeau et al., 2016) , may be efficacious at the time treatment is performed, but the diet remains susceptible to reinoculation posttreatment. Prolonged duration of effect approaches involves the addition of chemical agents to the feed or feed ingredient and remain incorporated through time of consumption such as medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), essential oils (EOs), organic acids, or formaldehyde (Dee et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2016b; Dee et al., 2016; Trudeau et al., 2016) . With documented evidence of potential for disease transmission via feed or feed ingredients, potential methods to mitigate such risk within a feed-manufacturing facility with a commercially available, safe, and efficacious product that has a prolonged mitigation activity would be valuable. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of a commercial benzoic acid (BA) product and an EO product as potential chemical mitigation strategies of PEDV in feed and spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) as determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and bioassay.",

Such documentation provides support for field-based reports of potential infection using feed as a vehicle (Pasick et al., 2014; Bowman et al., 2015) by realization that such minute quantities of foreign material can be incorporated into feed-manufacturing facilities through improper biosecurity procedures as previously described (Cochrane et al., 2016b) . A significant spatial and spatial-temporal clustering pattern was documented with the initial PEDV epidemic beginning in 2013 (Alvarez et al., 2016) , suggesting indirect spread such as aerosols or fomites could be a likely explanation. However, it has been established that pathogens including PEDV and PDCoV can be found in feed-manufacturing facilities and equipment, including truck pedals and flooring (Greiner et al., 2016) . Thus, failure of proper biosecurity by feed delivery personnel can contaminate a feed-manufacturing facility and subsequent deposition of infectious material into swine production facilities may contribute to the spread of the virus. Feed manufacturing and delivery is a complex procedure and a high level of biosecurity in such process is critical to maintenance of high herd health, but establishing such procedures is complex and additional research and education efforts are necessary to fully understand the complexity and methods needed to minimize potential disease transmission events (Dewey et al., 2014) . Research evaluating a potential mechanism for introduction of viral pathogens into the United States through a transboundary transportation model using feed, various feed ingredients, and pork products has been described (Dee et al., 2018) . Such a model demonstrates the plausibility of viruses to survive the conditions that could be expected based on shipment across large geographic regions and provides important information regarding risk differences among viruses and shipped products such that future mitigation strategies can be tailored to specific virus and product. The use of cost-effective, readily implementable, and safe feed additives to minimize risk of disease transmission would be a very useful tool in addition to biosecurity practices.",

EOs are plant-derived compounds that have been reported to possess antimicrobial characteristics against a number of pathogens including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses (Reichling et al., 2009) . With specific regard to antiviral capabilities, EOs have shown efficacy against enveloped viruses-primarily those affecting humans-including herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, Newcastle disease virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-associated coronavirus, and Junin virus by likely inhibiting viral replication (Reichling et al., 2009) . With specific regard to PEDV, there is little investigation as to the antiviral properties of various EO compounds. Cochrane et al. (2015) evaluated a 2% EO blend consisting of equal ratios of garlic oleoresin, turmeric oleoresin, capsicum oleoresin, rosemary extract, and wild oregano EOs, and observed the greatest reduction of quantifiable genetic material occurred approximately d 14 and beyond in both complete swine diet and spray-dried blood meal. Little impact was observed in spray-dried animal plasma. In the study herein, the combination of EO and BA had the greatest reduction in quantifiable genetic material late in the study period, similar to observations by Cochrane et al. (2015) , suggesting efficacy at reducing quantifiable RNA is not immediate. However, the use of EO alone did not result in a significant reduction in PEDV RNA. Although a dramatic increase in Ct is observed at d 21 and 42 post-laboratory inoculation, it is important to note that the infectivity of the PEDV is lost within complete swine feed by 1 d post-laboratory inoculation and between 7 and 14 d post-laboratory inoculation in SDPP. Thus, although the synergistic effect when combining a BA and EO product is interesting and worthy of investigation, viability of the virus is reduced beyond the point of infectious capability long before such effect on RNA is observed. Similar to Cochrane et al. (2015) , commercial products did not result in a significant increase in Ct in SDPP.",

Cochrane et al. (2015) used a custom organic acid blend included at 3% including lactic, propionic, formic, and BAs, which resulted in greater loss of PEDV genetic material over time compared to control, with the greatest efficacy observed in spraydried animal plasma compared to other matrices. Trudeau et al. (2016) investigated the use of dietary acidifiers including the commercial products Activate DA (0.4% inclusion; Novus International, St. Charles, MO), KEM-GEST (0.2% inclusion; Kemin Agrifoods, Des Moines, IA), Acid Booster (0.2% inclusion; AgriNutrition, DeForest, WI) and Ultracid P (0.3% inclusion; Nutriaid, Dendermonde, Belgium). Inactivation kinetics were improved with the inclusion of Activate DA, KEM-GEST, and Acid Booster compared to the control samples, indicating that inclusion of dietary acidifiers can increase the rate of inactivation of PEDV when experimentally inoculated in swine feed. In this study, addition of BA alone did not significantly increase PEDV Ct values in FEED nor SDPP. Inclusion rate of the dietary acidifiers evaluated by Trudeau et al. (2016) ranged from 0.2% to 0.4%, whereas inclusion of BA was 0.5% in this study. It is unclear if this difference in inclusion rate or other factors such as specific organic acids used or the specific blend of different organic acids led to the different response than that previously observed by Trudeau et al.

Pujols and Segales (2014) found spray-dried bovine plasma when infected with PEDV (2.8 log10 TCID 50 /mL) was not infective in cell culture at 7 d postinoculation when stored at room temperature, and infectivity was lost within 21 d when held at refrigerated temperatures. In the current study, all complete diet and SDPP samples were held at room temperature (approximately 23 \u00b0C) following inoculation until addition of PBS at appropriate day of analysis. SDPP not treated with chemical was infective in pig bioassay at 3 d post-laboratory inoculation, whereas infectivity was lost by 21 d indicating infective potential lasted somewhere between 3 and 21 d post-laboratory inoculation in untreated SDPP. Furthermore, SDPP treated with EO and BA was infective at 7 d post-laboratory inoculation, whereas complete swine diet (both untreated and treated with combination of EO and BA) lost infectivity by 1 d post-laboratory inoculation. This direct relationship provides additional evidence that PEDV viability is matrix dependent, and in the current experiment SDPP retained a greater quantity of detectible PEDV genetic material and harbored viable virus for significantly longer than complete swine diet.",

Furthermore, both untreated feed and feed treated with the combination of EO and BA resulted in infection at d 0 post-laboratory inoculation; however, neither set of samples were infective at d 1 postinoculation. Finally, SDPP harbored a greater level of quantifiable RNA for a longer duration of time compared to complete swine diet, and these viral particles remained viable for a longer duration of time indicating differences in viral stability exist between different feed matrices.",
