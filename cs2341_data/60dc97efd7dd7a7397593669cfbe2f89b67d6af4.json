            "text": "H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.",

            "text": "Avian influenza virus (AIV) is an important pathogen causing respiratory diseases (1, 2) and severe economic loss to poultry farming (3) , and is a serious menace to human health (4) . The H9N2 subtype of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) was first discovered in the United States in 1966. It appeared in China in 1992 and is now widely prevalent worldwide. The H9N2 subtype is still the most important AIV. Infection with this subtype of AIV can result in symptoms like respiratory diseases and decreased egg production in poultry, and may promote a few bacterial infections, leading to high mortality (5) . Moreover, H9N2 AIV can directly infect humans and other mammal (6, 7) . Studies have reported that the virus could be a gene donor of the other subtypes of AIV, like H5N1 (8) . In recent years, the H9N2 AIV has played an increasingly important role in the production of new influenza viruses, such as the H7N9 subtype AIV that has been widely spread in China since 2013, the H10N8 subtype AIV, which infected humans in Jiangxi Province, as well as the H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes that are currently prevalent in the poultry industry of China. Additionally, sequence analysis indicates that these internal genes are mainly derived from the H9N2 subtype AIV (9) , which highlights the role of H9N2 in the influenza virus ecosystem.",

However, the inactivated vaccines are not able to achieve the desired protective effect; the possible reasons could be low immunization frequency or unreasonable immunization procedure in clinical practice, and the antigenic variation of the epidemic strains, leading to unsatisfactory vaccine protection. Therefore, increasing cellular or mucosal immunity might be crucial to alleviate the limitations of the inactivated vaccine immunization. H9N2 virus is mainly transmitted through the respiratory mucosal pathway, which plays an important role in controlling avian influenza infection; however, conventional vaccines face difficulties in inducing mucosal immunity through the mucosal route. Thus, oral vaccines, which can simultaneously induce mucosal immunity and systemic immunity, might be a viable solution for the prevention and control of the H9N2 virus.",

As a probiotic, L. lactis that are naturally present in the intestines of humans and animals, provide certain nutrients to the body, inhibit the reproduction of harmful bacteria, maintain the balance of the gastrointestinal flora, and thus, improve the function of the gastrointestinal tract (10) . Furthermore, L. lactis can also stimulate immune cells, enhance the mucosal immune machinery, and naturally activate the immune response (11) (12) (13) . Many studies have shown that the recombinant expression of viral antigens by L. lactis can induce effective antiviral immune responses, such as expression of exogenous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus structural proteins, foot-and-mouth disease virus, rotavirus VP7 and VP8 proteins, porcine circovirus type 2 nucleocapsid protein, infectious bursal disease virus VP2 and VP3 proteins, and avian hepatitis E virus (14) (15) (16) (17) . In vivo experiments have shown that the foreign proteins are capable of inducing specific mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses and enhancing the ability of an animal to resist pathogen infection. Therefore, it would be advantageous to use L. lactis as a carrier to express foreign antigenic proteins.",

            "text": "The viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is an important immunoprotective antigen of H9N2 virus, which produces specific neutralizing antibodies in different animal models. Hemagglutinin absorbs cellular receptors, like sialic acid, in the host to mediate viral adsorption, transmembrane, and infection. The HA monomer can be cleaved to form HA1 and HA2, wherein the globular structure formed by HA1 is rich in receptor binding sites and has strong variability to recognize most neutralizing antibodies. The stem structure of HA2 is anchored in the viral envelope, and its primary function is to fuse the viral envelope with the cell membrane and release the nucleocapsid of the virion. In addition, the sequence of HA2 is highly conserved, especially in the same subtype; therefore, a vaccine based on the conserved region of HA2 is being considered. The AIV Section 7 RNA encodes matrix protein (M), including M1 and M2 proteins. M1 is responsible for the maintenance of the highly conserved structural protein of AIV that consists of 252 amino acid residues and accounts for 30-40% of the total viral proteins. The M1 protein is involved in many aspects of the viral life cycle and is one of the major target proteins for host T cell recognition during viral infection. Berthoud et al. used the vaccinia vector to express the influenza virus M1 gene, and the clinical trial results showed that the vaccine could induce a strong specific CD8 + T lymphocyte reaction in the body (18) . Okuda et al. found that the M1 protein-based nucleic acid vaccine not only protected against infection with the homologous influenza virus but also protected against infection with the heterologous influenza virus (19) . Therefore, the M1 protein is a potential candidate for the development of cross-protective vaccines.",

Currently, the most common strategy is to inoculate with inactivated vaccines for almost all poultry in China. However, the H9N2 AIV is still prevalent in China, although vaccine strains are constantly being updated. It is likely difficult to effectively control the spread of H9N2 AIVs using inactivated vaccines that mainly induce humoral immunity; thus, promoting mucosal immune responses may contribute to the control on H9N2 virus. In this study, we constructed a recombinant L. lactis strain, which secreted a M1-HA2 fusion protein of the H9N2 virus. The evaluation of the immune index showed that it induced substantial mucosal immunity and a good protective effect against virus challenge. The mucosa is the first physical barrier against the entry of pathogenic microorganisms into animals, and mucosal immune is the primary protection to microbial infection. The H9N2 initially enters the body through the respiratory mucosa; therefore, mucosal immunity must be an important and effective way to fight against H9N2 virus. The SIgA immunoglobulin is an important component of mucosal immunity (26) . It can form a protective barrier by adhesion to epithelial cells and can also adhere to the newly synthesized viral proteins in the infected cells then interfere with the virion assembly. The protective potential of the SIgA antibody appears to be the result of its polymeric nature, resulting in a higher affinity of the antibody for AIV and preventing infection by blocking adhesion to epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Our results indicated that the constructed recombinant L. lactis could secrete and express M1-HA2 fusion protein and induce substantial production of SIgA. After virus challenge, our results showed that recombinant L. lactis-immunized chickens induced immune protection, which was consistent with the results of inactivated vaccines, significantly inhibiting chicken weight loss, histopathological damage, and inflammatory response. In fact, the inactivated vaccine induced higher serum antibodies, which may be due to its higher antigen content and the effect of the vaccine adjuvant, but the recombinant L. lactis oral vaccine induced higher mucosal antibodies. Thus, the recombinant L. lactis can be used as an oral vaccine to compensate for functional deficiencies in inactivated vaccines. Moreover, the probiotic effect of L. lactis promoted cellular response and we also detected an up-regulation of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 cytokines which promoted the activation and proliferation of the intestinal mucosal lymphoid B cells and induced the secretion of specific SIgA. They participated in the transmission of information and played an important role in the biological processes of the organisms (27). As described above, the M1-HA2 fusion protein was expressed in L. lactis. The M1 protein, one of the most abundant proteins in virions, is relatively conserved. It may affect viral replication during early viral infection, mediating germination and assembly of progeny virions (28) . Hemagglutinin is a major target for neutralizing antibody agglutination. A subunit vaccine based on the conserved sequence HA2 induced a wide range of crossreactive antibody responses and provided protection against the influenza virus (29, 30) . Related studies have shown that the expression of M1 protein by E. coli can be used as a candidate protein for the development of novel influenza vaccines (31) . Previous studies have clarified the immune effects of M1 protein and the production of specific serum antibodies against H9N2 viruses (32) . Mice immunized with purified M1 antigen and chitosan showed strong immune responses and were resistant to infection by multiple subtypes of influenza virus (33) . In our study, we also selected the M1 protein, but due to its relatively small molecular mass, we fused it to another protective antigen, HA2. The immunogenicity of a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing this fusion protein was similar to that of a previouslyreported Lactobacillus strain expressing H9N2 M1 protein (34) . Previous reports have documented the immunoprotective effect of the HA2 protein. For instance, Lactobacillus plantarum expressing H9N2 HA2 could elicit anti-AIV humoral immunity and specific cell-mediated responses (35) . Moreover, a M2e-HA2 fusion protein antigen elicited broader and more potent viral inhibition than either of the fusion partners alone (36) . Another previous study showed that L. plantarum displaying an H9N2 M2e-HA2 fusion protein on the bacterial surface elicited protective immune responses against viral infection (37) . Although M2e contains conserved neutralization epitopes, its low immunogenicity requires it to be fused with other proteins or other high-molecular weight carriers to generate an immune response. The M1 protein used in our study is a highly conserved structural protein and has been used as a potential candidate for the design of cross-protective vaccines. Additionally, the M1 and HA2 genes used in this study were derived from a clinical H9N2 isolate which was selected based on its recognition by multiple sera. Moreover, the M1 and HA2 antigens were structurally separated by a linker sequence, theoretically allowing them to play distinct antigenic roles. Additionally, we added a secretory peptide gene to the expression vector, which resulted in secretion of the fusion protein from L. lactis. Therefore, our design has several improvements over previous studies.",

It stimulates the local immune response in the intestine while exerting probiotic effects on the animal body, thus improving the mucosal immunity and resisting colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria. This method is simple to operate, in compliance with the animal welfare regulations, and suitable for large-scale animal vaccination. In this study, a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein was successfully constructed.
