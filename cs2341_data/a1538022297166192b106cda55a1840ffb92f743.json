When the coronavirus infected cases and death were plugged in this model for Michigan, it is interested to see it fits this model very well since the outbreak of this disease. Then the author continues to update this fitting by using the daily reported data in Michigan, and attempt to predict the next few day's infected cases and death. On 3/28/2020, the author decided to plug all the U.S.A 25 infected cases and death data in this model, it is also surprised that this fits the Crow-AMSAA model as well. Then the author decided to write this paper to describe what is the Crow-AMSAA model and how the analysis has been done by author. The Crow-AMSAA model might be useful to predict the infected cases and death for a future pandemic. n(t) = \u03bbt \u03b2 (1) taking the natural logarithms of equation (1) Ln n(t) = Ln (\u03bb )+ \u03b2 Ln (t)",

In equation (2), the scale parameter, \u03bb, is the intercept on the y axis of n(t) when t =1, (ln(1) =0); the slope \u03b2, is interpreted in a similar manner as a Weibull plot, If the slope \u03b2 is greater than 1, the failure rate is increasing, the failure rate come more rapidly, if the slope \u03b2 is smaller than 1, the failure rate is decreasing, the failure rate come more slowly, if the 10 slope \u03b2 is equal to 1, the process is called homogenous Poisson process, if the slope \u03b2 is not equal 1, the process is called non-homogenous Poisson process.",

From the Fig. 2 , in the first 9 days (3/10/2020 to 3/18/2020), it has the less infected 20 cases, so the infected cases do not follow the Crow-AMSAA line, but after 3/19/2020, when the outbreak starts, the infected data fits the Crow-AMSAA line significantly.(See Fig. 2 , pink line). The death data in MI is also fitting Crow-AMSAA model. (See Fig. 2 , blue line). The interval prediction for both infected and death in Michigan are shown in Fig. 3 based on Crow-AMSAA. The author observed the predicted data versus the real data for past 13 days, although the 25 predicted number has the some deviation from the real number, the Crow-AMSAA is still a useful model for the Coronavirus 19 cases.",
