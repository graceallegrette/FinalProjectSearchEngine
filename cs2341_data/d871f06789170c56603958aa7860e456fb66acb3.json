On the one hand, our Civil Protection Headquarters, as well as all of the experts and scientists to whom media space has been provided, called for caution, but without any panic. They emphasized that this was not a cataclysm, but an epidemic involving a serious respiratory infectious disease. The cause of this disease is the new coronavirus, for which we do not have a vaccine. Therefore, it can be expected that the disease will be very dangerous for the elderly and to those who are already ill. So, it was an unknown danger worthy of caution, but our epidemiologists remained calm. They knew that they would be able to estimate the epidemic' s development using data and then control the situation with anti-epidemic measures, and through several lines of defence [1] .",

Now, let' s look at the countries that we can already point out as being successful in their response to this new challenge. First and foremost, there is China. It has completely suppressed the huge epidemic in Wuhan, which spread to all thirty of its provinces. In doing so, it relied on the advice of its epidemiologic legend, 83-year-old Zhong Nanshan. Twenty years ago, Nanshan gained authority by suppressing SARS. Although surprised by the epidemic, they managed to suppress COVID-19 throughout China through expert and determined measures. They did so over just seven weeks, with the death toll eventually coming to a halt at less than 4000 [2]. By comparison, it would be as if the number of deaths in Croatia as a result of this epidemic was kept at around 14 in total.",

For a long time, this city-state has been nurturing the ambition to lead the world in all measurable parameters. From this, it must be concluded that the developments in Singapore are a likely reflection of the real danger of COVID-19 in a country that is based on knowledge, technology, good organization, and general responsibility. Also, Singapore had a relatively recent SARS experience and learned from it, so they built capacity and ensured speed in their response to future challenges. The situation in Singapore, therefore, is an indicator of the effects of the virus on the population, to the extent that it is truly unavoidable.",

This conclusion can still be reached if it is properly understood that the information on the number of cases and deaths at the website \"https:// www.worldometers.info/coronavirus\" [2] is based on positive tests, and not on everyone who is actually infected.

The epidemic development by the end of February was already quite similar to the one seen previously with SARS and MERS. In both of those epidemics, the primary focal point was suppressed. Then, the virus was stopped using the first line of defence -identifying all those infected, tracing their contacts and isolating them all -in more than 25 countries. By the end of February 2020, it was already clear in the case of COVID-19 that it would be successfully suppressed in its primary focal point -Wuhan. It was also already stopped using the first line of defence in another thirty Chinese provinces and surrounding countries in Asia. Then, on the 28 th of February, the first estimates of death rates were published, suggesting that it was a disease with a death rate significantly lower than that of SARS and MERS [3, 4] . At that time, it was reasonable to expect that the epidemic could soon be stopped. As a result, the World Health Organisation delayed the declaration of a pandemic until the 11 th of March, and the world stock markets increased by about 10 percent from the 27 th of February to the 3 rd of March [5,6].

Fever does not accompany all COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission is possible, so infected tourists could have been allowed to enter Italy even where proper checks at the airports were in place [4] . Italy cancelled flights linking it directly with China on January 31 following the news of the epidemic spread [7] . Some investigative journalists hypothesized, although this has not been confirmed, that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of Chinese workers to northern Italy may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus [8]. Tens of thousands of Chinese migrants work in the Italian textile industry, producing fashion items, leather bags and shoes with the brand \"Made in Italy\". They worked in conditions where they were cramped closely together, which would facilitate the spread [8-10]. Reuters and the reporter D. T. Max wrote about this phenomenon back in 2014 and 2018, respectively [9,10]. Partly as a result of this development, direct flights between Wuhan and Italy were introduced. Previous reports claimed that there may be many illegal migrants among those workers [9,10]. Whether through Chinese tourists, textile workers, or through some other route, the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the Italian \"first line of defence\" which remained unrecognized in the first few weeks.",

In this way, more infected people emerged behind the front lines of defence in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark and Spain.

On the 19 th of February, a Champions League football match was held between Italy' s Atalanta and Spain' s Valencia. Atalanta is a team from a small city of Bergamo, Italy, which has 120 000 inhabitants. This was possibly the biggest game in Atalanta' s history, as it progressed through group stages to the last 16 in the European Champions League. The local stadium was not large enough for everyone who wanted to attend the game, so it was moved to a large San Siro stadium in Milan. The official attendance was 45 792, meaning that a third of Bergamo' s population, with around 30 busses, travelled from Bergamo to Milan and then wandered the streets of Milan before the game [13, 14] . Unfortunately for Spain, nearly 2500 Valencia fans also travelled to the match. As Atalanta scored four goals, a third of Bergamo' s population was hugging and kissing in the cold weather four times and spent the day closely together. This is likely why it became the worst-hit region of Italy by some distance. Moreover, at least a third of Valencia football squad also got infected with a virus and later played Alaves in the Spanish league, where further players of that team got infected. This football game has certainly contributed to the virus making its way to Spain [14] .",

It is difficult to know, at this time, which of these three causes is the most important -a combination of them all is entirely possible.

Then, they needed to read its genetic code and develop a diagnostic test. It all took time, as the epidemic spread rapidly throughout the city. When they began testing for coronavirus, between the 18 th and the 20 th of January, they had double-digit numbers of infected people [3] . Those numbers apparently stagnated, so the epidemiologists did not know what that might mean. But on the 21 st of January, the number of newly infected people jumped to more than 100. On the 22 nd of January, it jumped to more than 200 [3] . This was a clear signal to Chinese epidemiologists that an exponential increase in the number of infected people was occurring. At that time, they had nothing further to wait for, or to think about. If the virus breaks through the first line of defence -and the Chinese didn't even have any, since the epidemic started there unannounced -then a quarantine measure needs to be triggered. This prevents the virus from spreading further and generating a large number of infected people through the exponential growth of the epidemic.",

This \"time delay\" is a critically important factor that needs to be taken into account. However, even then, the Italians did not declare a quarantine. They did not do so on the 29 th of February, either, when the total number of infected people rose from 888 to 1128. Those figures implied that in mere days they would be having about 15 000 newly infected people each day.

The estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 in their article was 2.2, but with a very wide confidence interval -from 1.4 to 3.9. It is a bit of tough luck for the Italians, again, that they calculated the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 1.4 exactly. This figure is well known to all epidemiologists, it' s the rate of the spread of seasonal flu in the community. It should come as no surprise that many epidemiologists would guess that, with more data, R0 for COVID-19 would start converging more towards 1.4. Unfortunately, the more recent data suggests that R0 is more likely to lean towards 3.9, implying an incredibly fast spread.

The first reason was that the Chinese Centre for Disease Control reported all deaths in the Chinese epidemic using age groups structure that contained a very large age group of \"30-79 years\". It only separated children up to 10 years, then adolescents up to 20 years, then 20-29 year-olds, followed by this broad age group (30-79 years) and those who were 80 years or older. That is why the work of Onder and colleagues is commendable, as they subdivided this large group from China into 10-year age groups. This finally allowed a comparison between the first 1023 deaths in Wuhan (up to the 11 th of February) with the first 1625 deaths in Italy (up to the 17 th of March). The comparison is shown in Table 2 . It gives us some very important insights.",

So, contrary to the impression that individual media reports can easily make, COVID-19 is a very dangerous disease mainly for old people. Moreover, a recent study by A. and G. Remuzzi [25] showed that, among 827 deaths in Italy, the vast majority of those people were already severely ill with underlying diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and malignancies. This is what epidemiologists expected because a more severe flu would have had a similar effect if there was no vaccine available. However, I doubt that the general public has the proper insight into this issue from the prevalent media reports.",

However, Table 2 shows that death rates by the age of 70 are practically the same in China and Italy. Then, although the case fatality rate appears to be about 50% greater in Italy than in China for the age group 70-79, this does not suggest that the virus may have mutated. It is known that in Wuhan, many of the affected with a severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 could rely on the two newly built hospitals and respiratory aids that the military had brought in from other parts of China [26] . They also had medical teams coming in from other provinces [26] . In Italy, however, there were not enough respirators for this age group, and there weren't enough doctors either, as many of them themselves became infected [16, 20] . For those two reasons I would, in fact, expect even a larger difference between Italy and China than the one we are seeing, so I would not attribute this observed difference to the impact of the virus itself. And finally, the reported difference in case-fatality rates for the oldest age group should also not be attributed to the virus. It is more likely a consequence of the fact that Italians of Lombardy live, on average, longer than the Chinese of Wuhan [27] . Therefore, there are significantly more people in the oldest age group in Italy, ranging to much higher ages, so the two oldest groups are not really comparable. The average age of the Italians in the age group \"80 years or older\" is significantly greater than the average age of the oldest Chinese age group. Therefore, the table shows practically equal death rates across all age groups, on sufficiently large samples, meaning that the virus did not mutate in Italy from the virus we see from Wuhan, at least not until the 17 th of March, 2020.",

There are such cases with every infectious disease. They are also present during the flu epidemics, but they are extremely rare. This suddenly gives us another possible strategy for quarantine exit, where children and those under 50 years of age could first emerge if they do not have any underlying illnesses. Here, after this table, it already seems like we are beginning to have an increasing number of options to get out of quarantines and learn to live with this virus until the vaccine becomes available. However, at least a few more studies need to be carried out to confirm that this age group can be substantially protected, to provide reassurance that the virus is not becoming more dangerous for those younger than 50 years, too. There is another strangeness to the situation in Italy that will not be intuitive to the general public. The actual number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Italy will not be possible to estimate for several months after the epidemic finally ends. Namely, at present, due to the sole focus on the epidemic, most of the cases of death of very old people who have been diagnosed using a throat swab have been attributed to COVID-19. However, once the epidemic is over, it will be necessary to compare the deaths in individual areas of Italy with the average for the same months in the previous few years. It could be shown that a part of the already ill would have died in the same month, or a year, even without being infected with the new coronavirus. It is possible that among some of them COVID-19 accelerated this inevitability by a few weeks or months. Some of the deaths observed during the epidemic in Italy may need to be reclassified later and attributed to underlying diseases in accordance with expected levels, and those above expected levels will then be attributed to COVID-19.",

A combination of an early relaxation over this epidemic, systematic lack of expertise in the field of epidemic infectious diseases in Europe, likely inexperience in containing epidemic spread in this generation of health workers, relaxed immigration regulations for workers in certain industries, Champions League football event and a series of further misfortunes and omissions have all been implied so far in the media as contributors to the late withdrawal of Lombardy into quarantine. This allowed, through exponential growth, for a large number of people to be infected in a very short time -far too large for health systems of Italy and other EU countries to cope with. Severe forms of illness led to many deaths due to respiratory failure. In 88% of cases, people over 70 years of age died, who had underlying illnesses in the large majority of cases. This viewpoint is based on the first 1625 deaths in Italy, and by the time of this writing, there are now more than 10 000 dead. Given the size of the population, this would correspond to 670 deceased in Croatia. If Croatia manages not to follow the numbers of deceased seen in Italy, this will mostly be attributable to social exclusion measures being introduced early enough for its health system to come with severe cases.",
