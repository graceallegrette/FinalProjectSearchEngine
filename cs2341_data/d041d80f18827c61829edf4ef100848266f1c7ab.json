To explore this hypothesis, we first examined the binding of four coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV with human ACE2 from a computational approach. In brief, the RBD structures of RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV were first built by homology modeling based on the template structures 3 Figure 1B ). This is rather consistent with recent findings that SARS-CoV-2 binds much stronger with ACE2 than SARS-CoV 3 . Moreover, our results showed that two bat-originated CoVs can't bind efficiently with human ACE2 as compared with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, implicating that an intermediate host may exist before the zoonotic transfer of coronaviruses. In another word, batoriginated coronaviruses may have to use an intermediate host as reservoir for adaptation or recombination before the efficient transmission to humans.",

We want to remind the reader that our study is based on the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may be a cross-species spillover of bat-originated CoVs into an intermediate host via ACE2 before the exposure to human. Moreover, we don't rule out the possibility of a direct transmission of coronaviruses from bats or other natural reservoir to human, which is warranted for further investigation. The continuous surveillance of pneumonia in humans and suspicious animals including tree shrew and ferret are critical to understand and control the zoonotic transmission events caused by SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, our study provides the medical and public health research communities with predictive insights which may facilitate to control and battle against the devastating SARS-CoV-2. author/funder.

Importantly, the cross-species spillover of bat-adapted CoVs into an intermediate host has been accounted for the emergence of several zoonotic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This intermediate host is identified as palm civets for SARS-CoV, while camels are thought to play the role of intermediate host for MERS-CoV. Analogously, as of March 2020, several facts implicate that another wild animal may act as an intermediate host between bats and humans for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 2 . However, the existence and identity of possible intermediate host for the SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined. Computational analysis of the viral receptors binding with the host receptors may help to quickly pin down possible intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.",

Subsequently, the complex structures of RaTG13-CoV-RBD with 47 ACE2 receptors were predicted by protein docking followed by MD simulation and the binding free energies of all complex structures were computed by MM/PBSA method. Interestingly, our results revealed that Tupaia chinensis (tree shrew) and Mustela furo (ferret) obtained the top-two best binding free energies as compared to other species (D\uf044G: -678.22 kcal/mol for tree shrew; D\uf044G: -665.86 kcal/mol for ferret; see Figure 2). In addition, the binding of RaTG13-CoV-RBD with tree shrew and ferret is much stronger than that of pangolin (D\uf044G, -506.49 kcal/mol; see Figure 2 and SI_dataset_1). This suggest that pangolin may not be the intermediate host should SARS-CoV-2 was a nature selection by mutation or recombination from bat coronaviruses. The major limitation of the present study is the lack of additional datasets of ACE2 proteins for more animal species. In addition, our analysis is based on the hypothesis that bat-originated coronaviruses use ACE2 as a cell-entry receptor for the infection of intermediate animals and therefore we only focus on the interaction of CoV-RBDs with ACE2 receptors. Nevertheless, our study suggests that intermediate animals may exist and supports the call for surveillance of suspicious intermediate animal hosts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",
