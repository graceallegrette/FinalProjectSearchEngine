In particular, there are concerns relating to the transmission of COVID 19 during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery, arising from the potential generation of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated aerosols from CO2 leakage and the creation of smoke from the use of energy devices.

AGPs can create a risk of airborne transmission of infections that are usually only spread by droplet transmission. Due to the high viral load in respiratory secretions, intubation and extubation remain one of the highest risk AGPs (Meng et al., 2020) . The main at-risk healthcare professionals are thus anaesthetists and emergency department clinicians and guidance is available in the wider literature to safeguard these clinicians and reduce transmission risks (Wong et al., 2020) . Many emergency laparoscopic procedures will still be required during this pandemic, however very little is known regarding the risks to the health care professions undertaking these procedures. The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy and extrapolated data from previous outbreaks, to guide the safe management of suspected and positive COVID 19 patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.",

SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in faeces in 29% of cases , presumably thorough transmission from the naso-pharynx with ingestion into the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is less commonly found in blood, with studies reporting viral RNA positive samples in 1-15% of COVID 19 patients , Chen W et al., 2020 , Young et al., 2020 , Chan et al., 2020 , Huang et al., 2020 . The virus has not been found in the female genital tract in women with proven COVID 19, although the data are few , Fan et al., 2020 . Hence operations carried out by other specialities such as ENT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are at a higher risk of generating aerosols and have more significant safety concerns (RCS, 2020) . Moreover, bowel surgery may have different implications compared to gynaecological interventions. Thus, there is currently insufficient evidence to support adopting a universal open approach to surgery for gynaecological indications.",
