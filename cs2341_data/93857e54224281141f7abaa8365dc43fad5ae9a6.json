Production costs were obtained from data compiled by Meta Farms (MetaFarms, Burnsville, MN), USDA-AMS, and Iowa State University (Ames, IA) in 2015 (Table 1) . The price per feeder pig was calculated by using the composite weighted average price (formula and cash) of an 18 kg feeder pig from the National Direct Delivered Feeder Pig Report NW_LS255. The feeder pig price ($55.51 per pig) was based on an average of weekly prices reported during 2015 (USDA-AMS, 2017a). However, the feeder pigs in this study were lighter at 13 kg. In order to appropriately apply a feeder pig price, a linear relationship was used between price and weight. The feeder pig price used in this model was $41.63 per pig. Feed costs were applied based on the feed budget assigned per feeding phase. Major ingredient prices were calculated from the North Central Iowa corn prices report NW_GR110, Iowa DDGS report NW_GR111, and Iowa SBM report NW_ GR116 (USDA-AMS, 2017b, c, d). Other ingredient prices were obtained from Meta Farms. Based on a weighted average of ingredient prices, diet costs across phases were calculated to be $201.67/t. Transportation costs were obtained from the Iowa State University Ag Decision Maker website ($3.90/ loaded mile, semi-trailer; Plastina and Johanns, 2015) . Assuming a semi-trailer capacity of 500 feeder pigs, and transportation distance of 25 miles, the cost of transportation for feeder pigs used in this model is $0.195 per pig placed. Assuming truck capacity of 130 market pigs and a distance to market of 50 miles, the cost of transportation for market pigs used in this model was $1.50 per market pig. A base price for veterinary costs ($5.00/ pig placed) was obtained from Meta Farms and was applied to the LCh barn. The MCh and HCh barns incurred additional veterinary costs of $2.37 and $2.02/pig sold, respectively. These added costs were due to the increased number of pig treatments in these barns and the medications used related to different clinical symptoms. An assumed yardage cost ($0.115/pig space/d) was obtained from Meta Farms. Yardage costs can be a major component of the total costs of pork production, and vary significantly from one producer to the next. Yardage is broadly defined as overhead costs, and incorporates Total revenue was calculated based on income generated by marketing pigs to both a primary market and secondary market for light-cull pigs. Profit was determined after total costs were subtracted from total revenue and reported for the entire barn on a per pig marketed and per pig placed basis. These values were compared across treatment to estimate losses due to a HC, relative to the LCh treatment.",

However, it is not possible to replicate a disease treatment across multiple barns; as demonstrated in this study, health status within a barn can change over time, making replication improbable. However, great care was taken to ensure that any potential differences among the barns other than disease were minimized; as previously explained, the three barns were identical in design and construction, were all managed by the same person, were of the same genetic origin and received the same dietary regime. All three barns were located on the same site to eliminate the chance of differences in weather affecting outcomes. On this basis, it was concluded that the pen within the barn can be considered the experimental unit, although the chance of other factors besides HC affecting performance cannot be completed precluded.

Exposure to PRRSV and IAV-S will cause lethargy, reduced growth rates, and increase mortality and morbidity (Rochell et al., 2015; Schweer, 2015; Schweer et al., 2016a) . Exacerbated symptoms in the event of multiple infections are expected; however, very little data exist to confirm this and quantify its impact. Van Reeth et al. (1996) reported intensified clinical symptoms in the event of a PRRSV co-challenge with IAV-S or porcine respiratory coronavirus in feeder pigs. They noted that clinical symptoms were variable in different groups of pigs challenged with the same PRRSV-IAV-S combination, demonstrating that co-challenges are difficult to reproduce and will impact pigs differently than an infection with a single virus. Much like Van Reeth's experiment, pigs in this study had exacerbated clinical symptoms in the MCh and HCh treatments due to the PRRSV and IAV-S co-challenge but the HCh was more severely impacted than the MCh. The number of injectable medications increased by 111% and 208% in the MCh and HCh treatments, respectively, compared to LCh. Mortality was similarly increased by 133% and 503% in the MCh and HCh treatments, respectively. The mortality observed in the present study was greater than expected based on the current literature. In an economic analysis by Holtkamp et al. (2013) , greater severity of a PRRSV infection increased mortality by as much as 35%.",

The study reported herein characterized the relative health status of the three barns but did not comprehensively diagnose all potential pathogens in the three barns. To test for all potential pathogens would have been cost prohibitive and, as some definitive tests require post-mortem samples, would have interfered with growth and performance data of the pigs. Thus, knowing absolute health status comprehensively and collecting performance data with minimal iatrogenic manipulation is very challenging. One of the explanations for variance between the numbers reported by Holtkamp et al. (2013) and those measured here could be the undetected presence of additional pathogens that were not included in the Holtkamp analysis.",

Due to suppressed growth rates, days to market was lengthened by 10 and 15 d in the MCh and HCh, respectively, compared to LCh. Schweer (2015) reported 14 greater days to market when pigs experienced a PRRSV infection.The design of this experiment dictated that pigs were marketed at a similar BW, to provide the best comparison for the HC effects on carcass composition. It would be expected that the slower growing pigs would tend to be leaner and would deposit less fat (Williams et al., 1997c; Schweer 2015) ; however, this was not observed in the present experiment.Using parameters for growth, mortality, and full-value pigs sold, Neumann et al. (2005) first assessed the financial burden of PRRSV to U.S. pig producers as $494 USD million. Later, Holtkamp et al. (2013) estimated these losses at $664 USD million in grow-finish pigs. In a recent interim report, Holtkamp reported that the economic impact of PRRSV has fallen by $83 million USD to $581 million USD in grow-finish pigs (Miller, 2017) . Both economic models in the present study reveal serious losses in the event of a PRRSV and IAV-S co-challenge under commercial conditions; however, the fixed-time model resulted in greater losses when calculated on a per barn-turn basis. Neumann et al. (2005) estimated PRRSV cost U.S. hog producers $7.67 USD/pig, while Holtkamp et al. (2013) reported production losses of $4.67 USD for every pig marketed in the U.S. Unfortunately, these economic analyses by Neumann and Holtkamp only assess the economic contribution of a PRRSV infection. They also represent \"average\" losses estimated across the total US pig herd. The results of this experiment suggest that the economic impact of a co-challenge can vary widely.In conclusion, increasing severity of HC under commercial conditions reduced ADG by 8% and 14% and resulted in mortality as high as 19.9%. Losses of $9.49 to $25.32/pig marketed underscores the potential magnitude of the economic impact of mixed etiology concurrent diseases in pork production.",
