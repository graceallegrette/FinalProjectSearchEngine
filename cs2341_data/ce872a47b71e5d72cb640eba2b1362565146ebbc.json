The earliest map visualisation of the relationship between place and health was in 1694 on plague containment in Italy [7] . The value of maps as a communication tool blossomed over the next 225 years in the service of understanding and tracking infectious diseases, such as yellow fever, cholera and the 1918 influenza pandemic. From the 1960s, when computerised geographic information systems were born, the possibilities for analysing, visualising and detecting patterns of disease dramatically increased again. A 2014 review of the health GIS literature found that 248 out of 865 included papers (28.7%) focused on infectious disease mapping [8] .",

From a Chinese perspective this is a really useful service for people and a really powerful tool that shows the power of data being used for good\" [22] . A related and complementary voluntary system was implemented in Guangzhou Underground (Guangdong Province, China) , so that if a person is later diagnosed with coronavirus, it would be easier to track her/ his transport routines and notify related passengers who boarded the same metro carriages. Starting on 17 February 2020, every metro carriage in Guangzhou Underground displays a unique QR code that passengers are invited to scan once they board the carriage. They then need to quickly fill in an online form that appears on their phone, which includes name, ID No. (optional), gender, their starting metro station and their destination station. As each carriage has a unique QR code, if the passenger walks into another carriage during transportation, s/he will have to scan the new QR code of that carriage and (auto) fill in the corresponding form again. If the passenger's journey involves changing to other metro lines to reach their final destination, then s/he will have to repeat the same process for every additional carriage they board (Fig. 6 ).",

Despite strong actions to curb the spread, an estimated five million people potentially exposed to the virus had already left Wuhan before the city was placed under quarantine, complicating containment efforts. Understanding travel patterns can help health authorities worldwide establish quarantine stations and passenger screening programmes at major international airports Page 9 of 12 Kamel Boulos and Geraghty Int J Health Geogr (2020) 19:8 to place Wuhan under quarantine, which was unprecedented at scale. By the end of January 2020, Chinese authorities had enforced further transportation restrictions in 15 additional cities. The WorldPop research group at Southampton University, UK, used historical data and patterns from Baidu's location services and international flight itineraries to better understand population movements out of Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown, look at travellers' volumes and destinations across China and the world, and compile a predictive global risk map for the likely spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus from its epicentre in Wuhan. According to WorldPop's analysis, within mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk, while the most 'at-risk' places worldwide are Thailand (1st), Japan (2nd) and Hong Kong (3rd), followed by the USA (6th), Australia (10th) and the UK (17th).

            "text": "Modern GIS technologies centre around web-based tools, improved data sharing and real-time information to support critical decision-making. Dashboards exemplify those ideals and have been extremely popular in sharing and understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Communication through map-based dashboards offers accessible information to people around the world eager to protect themselves and their communities. This tool type improves data transparency and helps authorities disseminate information. Certainly, dashboards have taken centre stage in COVID-19 outbreak awareness. But we hope that readers consider how a comprehensive GIS platform can support the entire process of infectious disease surveillance, preparedness and response, because as one epidemiologist put it, outbreaks like this \"should be expected to happen more frequently moving forward\" [16] . In other words, it is not a question of if another outbreak will occur, but when and where. Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 know no country or continent boundaries.",
