Neither data from the German Robert-Koch-Institut nor the data from the Johns Hopkins University are correct, for we have to reasonably assume that there are a number of unknown cases. It is guessed that the data covers only 15% of the real cases. Considering this we get a slightly changed result pictured in fig. 4 . The maximum number of infected people including the estimated number of unknown cases is a bit higher than the result showed in fig. 3 . This can be explained by the small reduction of the S stock. 1 I0 denotes the initial value of the I species, that is March 27th 2020. Imax stands for the maximum of I.

This group has a significant higher mortality rate than the rest of the infected people. Thus we can presume that \u03b1=10% of I must be especially sheltered and possibly medicated very intensively as a highrisk group.
