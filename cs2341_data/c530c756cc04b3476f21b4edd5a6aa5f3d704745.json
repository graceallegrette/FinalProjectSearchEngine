While all efforts should be made toward prevention and/or containment of the 2019/2020 outbreak, it is evident that contingency measures with experimental therapeutics must be urgently sought. With the average cost of de novo drug development reportedly over $1 billion USD, what are viable strategies to discover potential candidate drugs to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)? Here we take a snapshot look at the strategy of drug repurposing -also known as drug reprofiling or repositioning -that promises to identify antiviral agents for the novel coronavirus disease in a time-critical fashion. We also offer a perspective that antiviral combinations with a 'double hit effect' may offer the best chance of success and clinical translatability.",

Andersen et al. have recently summarized 31 potential candidates for COVID-19 in a highly accessible database of 120 experimental, investigational and approved agents [2] . Conceptually, BSAAs take advantage of the promiscuity of viral replicative mechanisms and host interactions to target two or more viral families [3] . Following the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a few existing BSAAs have been rapidly introduced into clinical trials, spanning Phases II though IV. Umifenovir is a membrane fusion inhibitor targeting viral entry and lopinavir/ritonavir is a drug combination targeting viral protease, both approved for the indications of Influenza and HIV. They are currently being considered in different combinations in a Phase IV clinical trial for pneumonia associated with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04255017) [4] .",

One way to circumvent this issue is to evaluate two or more drugs acting on different cellular signaling pathways involving viral replication with minimal redundancy. Another strategy is high-throughput screening of compound libraries for synergistic combinations at the host-virus interactome level for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which may allow researchers to narrow down the spectrum of individual antimicrobials [3, 12, 13] . These strategies promise to address the often-weak activity of BSAAs by improving efficacy while potentiating dose reductions, reducing duration, cost of the drug development pipeline, lowering toxicity and minimizing emergence of secondary resistance.",

As elegantly demonstrated by Ferron et al., the nsp14-ExoN of SARS-CoV forms part of a highly flexible complex with multienzymatic properties, likely facilitating compensated low fidelity of replication. What are viable strategies to circumvent this remarkable innate ability of coronaviridae to proofread their RNA and maintain genomic integrity, while allowing some degree of evolutionary freedom to mutate? Again high-throughput screening can come to the rescue here. Possibilities include compounds with affinity toward the nsp14-ExoN catalytic subunit or those with allosteric effects at critical sites with conserved residues causing conformational change of the entire viral RNA repair complex. Therefore, the hunt should now be on to identify an inhibitor of this viral nuclease.",
