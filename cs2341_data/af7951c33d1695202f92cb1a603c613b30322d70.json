Those requiring allogeneic transplant and especially those that have HLA disparity or T-cell-depleted grafts have an even higher risk of infective complications due to delayed recovery of T-and B-cell function. Early identification with prompt effective treatment is paramount to improve all patients' survival. Patient safety through robust adherence to hand hygiene and maintenance of the environment with cleaning and disinfection are the backbone of an effective preventative program. Basic nursing care and a sound knowledge base of the risks, presentation, diagnosis and treatment will improve patient care.",

CMV is usually acquired in childhood. It is a virus that is present worldwide, and whilst in developed countries approximately 50% of the population is seropositive, this rises to almost 100% in developing countries. CMV is shed intermittently from the oropharynx and from the genitourinary tract of both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people. Prior to allograft the serostatus (IgG) of the patient and potential donors are assessed to gauge risk (Zaia et al. 2009 ). (Mackall et al. 2009) CMV belongs to the human herpesvirus family HHV5 and comes from the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. Betaherpesvirinae infects the mononuclear cells, establishes latency in the leukocytes and once reactivated replicates slowly. CMV is able to lie dormant for protracted lengths of time, and immunity to the CMV complex involves both the humoral and cell-mediated pathways. Patients treated with stem cell transplantation in the context of haematological malignancies can reactivate the latent virus, either from native host leucocytes, from those derived from the donor, or from both. The risk of reactivation varies dependent upon the patient and/or donor's previous exposure to CMV. CMV status can be shown as follows:",

It is defined as a lymphoid proliferation or lymphoma that develops as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant. The immunosuppression required to preserve graft function post-transplant leads to an impairment of T-cell immunity. This allows an uncontrolled proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. This results in monoclonal or polyclonal plasmacytic hyperplasia, B-cell hyperplasia, B-cell lymphoma or immunoblastic lymphoma. Immune surveillance is impaired; the balance between latently infected B-cell proliferation and the EBV-specific T-cell response is disrupted and leads to the infected B cells developing into PTLD (Heslop 2009 ).",

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a major procedure, which needs the use of chemotherapy. Some patients who are undergoing allogeneic transplantation for haemato-oncological malignancies will require radiotherapy. The use of these treatments, coupled with the patient's disease, compromises the immune system. The administration of immunosuppressant to prevent graft rejection contributes also to the high risk of infections in this patient group (Brown 2010) .",

Consistent with the organization of the department, it would be advisable to hospitalize the patient in a single room with attached bathroom, in order to give them greater comfort. The ventilation system should ensure at least 12 air changes per hour; a direct flow area of the room must have the way out on the opposite side with respect to that of entry. The optimum ambient air quality can be obtained without using the expensive laminar flow. The rooms, housing highly immunocompromised patients, need to be placed under positive pressure to prevent the entry into the room of airborne pathogens in the hallway or in adjacent spaces. In the rooms it is forbidden to keep fresh flowers and/or dried and potted plants (Tomblyn et al. 2010) . Although it is unlikely that exposure to plants causes invasive fungal infections in patients undergoing HSCT, it is recommended that plants and dried or fresh flowers do not enter the room during hospitalization (conditioning phase included) because of the Aspergillus sp., isolated from soil of ornamental plants and flowers. In addition it was found a high proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the water of the cut flower vase (Pseudomonas) (Tomblyn et al. 2010) .",

Loss of body image as a result of weight loss or scars, sexuality issues and concerns about employment may preoccupy a patient (Gruber et al. 2003 ). Nurses should be aware of the potential effect that both, the transplant and the isolation, can have on patients. Spending time with the patient and offering him or her an opportunity to talk about concerns can be helpful.

In some cases, the patient may become overdependent on nursing staff, and this may need to be addressed.

The spectrum of pulmonary complications for transplant recipients will continue to change, due in part to rapid advances in supportive care, the increasing age of transplant recipients, new antiviral and antifungal agents and an increasing use of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics posttransplant (Sharma et al. 2005) . The real key, however, to decreasing morbidity and mortality in adult and paediatric HSCT patient populations remains in effective diagnostic techniques (Stephens et al. 2013) . Pulmonary infections are the largest cause of post-HSCT infective morbidity and have been reported in most recipients, carrying a mortality rate of 20% (Cooke et al. 2008; Zuccotti et al. 2005) . The principal cause of infection is the severe immunocompromised status of the patients from the disease process (malignant or non-malignant), conditioning regimens (non-myeloablative and myeloablative) and immunosuppressive prophylaxis to prevent and treat GvHD. A CT study by Escuissato et al. (2005) found that viral infections (51%) were the most common in posttransplant recipients, followed by bacterial infections (23%), fungal infection (19%) and protozoal infections (less than 1%). In 5% of the cases examined, patients had two or more infectious agents concurrently.",

            "text": "Diagnostic techniques for pulmonary disease in HSCT patients are similar to that for non- transplant patients. Chest radiograph (X-ray) and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan remain the most popular and less invasive options. CT scans are particularly useful when compared with two-dimensional X-rays because they can expose acute and chronic changes in the lung parenchyma. Respiratory CT scans involve taking pictures of cross-sections of lung tissue using high special-frequency reconstruction during inhalation and exhalation (Stephens et al. 2013 ). Changes such as nodules, \"white out\" and a \"glassy\" appearance signal the physician and radiology staff to consider additional diagnostics (Truong et al. 2010) . This could include collecting sputum samples, bronchoscopy with or without bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), open lung Table 7 .5 Typical onset of pulmonary complications following stem cell transplantation divided into three stages based on information from Antin and Raley (2009) Camus and Costabel (2005) , Coomes et al. (2010) , Polovich et al. (2009) , and Soubani and Pandya (2010) (Kaplan et al. 2011; Truong et al. 2010) . Sputum samples can be collected by nurses, physicians or respiratory therapists according to transplant program protocols. Respiratory virus detection is highly dependent on the type of sample collected, the time of collection after the onset of clinical symptoms, the age of the patient and the transport and storage of the sample prior to testing. Several different upper respiratory tract specimens are applicable for testing, including nasopharyngeal (NP) washes, NP aspirates and NP swabs placed in virus transport media (Specter 2009; Storch 2000) . Expectorations in the early morning or after a respiratory procedure can be the easiest for the patient to produce because of the natural accumulation of secretions at these times. About 15 ml of sputum is usually required for adequate laboratory analysis, and a recent study suggested that the sputum must reach the laboratory within a few hours from expectoration (Murray et al. 2010) . Sputum can also be collected during a bronchoscopy. In some cases, broncholveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed during the bronchoscopy. BAL involves the flushing of fluid (usually a sterile normal saline solution) into a localized area of the lower respiratory tract and then immediately suctioning the fluid up the bronchoscope and into a sterile specimen container. BAL allows for the detection and characterization of several respiratory pathogens, including viral, fungal and bacterial agents, and is considered a major diagnostic mechanism for Pneumocystis carinii (now called Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia (PCP) (Forsl\u00f6w et al. 2010) . In patients with focal pulmonary lesions, aspergillosis or pulmonary GvHD, fine-needle aspiration biopsy is considered the first-line diagnostic method (Gupta et al. 2010) .",

Bedside nurses are the most likely to observe subtle changes in the patient's condition, and for this reason it is critical that nursing staff working with the HSCT population be highly trained in oncology and critical care interventions. Prompt reporting of symptoms can ensure proper and timely medical intervention and facilitate improved patient outcomes. This has been found particularly true in identifying GvHD, with clinical nurses at the forefront of identifying and reporting suspicious symptoms to the healthcare team (Mattson 2007 ). Nurses take a central role in patient and family education regarding the course of treatment, complications and other key pieces of the HSCT process, including caring for a central line (Stephens et al. 2013) . By educating patients on what to expect after transplant with regard to troubling symptoms, nurses ensure patient participation in identifying developing complications early and improving HSCT outcomes. A thorough assessment can assist the nursing staff in detecting changes indicative of developing complications. Vital signs, including the rate and quality of respirations, and oximetry should be performed per program protocols, usually every 4 h and more frequently for patients at risk for pulmonary insufficiency. Taking the patient's temperature every 4 h or as necessary is another critical respiratory intervention, as most post-HSCT complications are infectious in nature (Stephens et al. 2013 ). Nurses are crucial in assessing patients for symptoms of bacterial infection and should perform routine laboratory tests as necessary. Regarding pulmonary infections, nurses should closely monitor patients for symptoms of progressing respiratory disease, such as decreased auscultation of air sounds in the lungs, increasing fevers and appearance of a productive cough with coloured sputum. Antibiotics should start as soon as possible in these patients. A nursing study of neutropenic patients in the early HSCT phase showed that commencement of antibiotics within 1 h of the onset of infectious symptoms can significantly reduce infectious complications, including sepsis (Hyman 2005) . The recent addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to GvHD prophylaxis protocols has been met with mixed results. For example, a study using infliximab did not lead to lower rates of GvHD but did suggest higher rates of bacterial or fungal pulmonary infection in patients who participated in the study (Hamadani et al. 2008) . It is important that patients in the post-transplant period are encouraged to pace their activity with their level of ability. Coughing and deep breathing exercises accompanying the regular use of an incentive spirometer constitute critical ways to open deep alveolar tissue and encourage pulmonary toileting on patients prone to fatigue and malaise and whose blood counts are very low (Stephens et al. 2013).",
