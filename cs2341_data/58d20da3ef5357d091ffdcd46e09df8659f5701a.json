Without sufficient herd immunity, the Covid-19 epidemic will revert to its original dynamic course as soon as interventions are withdrawn. 3 This resurgence can only be prevented if most countries in the world follow China's example and jointly maintain intensive control for a long time, probably years, until the very last cases have been tracked down and isolated. Furthermore, countries with residual circulating virus would have to be completely isolated to avoid reintroduction. Still, prolonged intensive control could be a means to gain time until the development and large-scale availability of a vaccine. However, the amount of time this will take is unpredictable. An alternative approach is to develop herd immunity through natural infection while keeping the number of cases within the limits of the health care system. Until recently, the UK has advocated this approach, 4 but it was heavily criticized for obvious reasons: it will be practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting health care capacity. Clearly, there is a need for an exit strategy that is predictable and controllable. We believe that we have found such a strategy.",

That is, in successive parts of the country (say provinces or municipal health services catchment areas) all stringent interventions are released, such that the epidemic can rage locally, while maintaining strict control in the remaining parts that wait for their turn. At the same time, Covid-19-related IC admissions should be distributed over the whole country such that the national health care system is not overburdened. After the lift of control in their area, its inhabitants can resume their normal daily activities as before Covid-19. Importantly, individuals most vulnerable to the virus need to be shielded until their area has achieved herd immunity. A further requirement is that their care providers (professionals or possibly family members) are absolutely free of the virus or immune. Obviously, this strategy will require a lot of ambulance transport of severe cases, but this should be feasible in small countries with good infrastructure, such as the Netherlands. Larger countries can consider implementing the strategy in specific geographic regions. Box 1 provides a summary of the strategy, including minimum conditions and a calculation of the IC capacity threshold in terms of the number of prevalent Covid-19 cases in the population.",

            "text": "To explain the potential impact, let's do a back-of-the-envelope calculation taking the Netherlands context as an example. The country can harbor at most 10 thousand prevalent infectious cases per million population without overstretching the health care system (Box 1). At this maximum, the average flow (incidence) is about 1000 new Covid-19 cases per day, i.e. 10 thousand prevalent cases divided by the presumed average duration of infectiousness of 10 days. 3 Given the estimated basic reproduction number R0 = 2.5, 3,5 at least 60% (1 -1/R0) of the population should have experienced the infection and have acquired immunity in order to provide herd immunity to the remaining 40%. To achieve the required 600 thousand immune individuals per million population -under optimal use of healthcare capacity -will take at least 600 days (600 thousand/1000 new cases per day). Now suppose we implement the strategy of a phased lift of control and divide a hypothetical country with 1 million inhabitants into 10 equal parts (say provinces) with 100 thousand inhabitants each. We then lift control in the first selected province and allow, e.g., 75% of the national supply of IC beds to be used for Covid-19 patients from this province. The remaining 25% can be used for severe Covid-19 cases in the rest of the country. Then the selected province can harbor 7500 cases (i.e. 7.5 times as many as a strategy focusing on the country as a whole). Thus, ideally, only 600/7.5 = 80 days are needed to reach the required number of immunes in this province. Subsequently, the next province can be chosen to lift control, again requiring about 80 days, and so on. The 10-th and last province will lift control on day 720. This is somewhat longer than the 600 days above, but on average individuals in the country will be free of interventions after 360 days.",

            "text": "There are several factors that influence the duration of this strategy in practice. First of all, local outbreaks will not show stable levels but typically display epidemic peaks, effectively requiring the average number of cases to stay well below the IC threshold. This will obviously prolong the overall duration needed. On the other hand, some efficiency will be gained from heterogeneity in contact rates: initially those with many daily contacts will acquire the infection first, such that those who remain uninfected (non-immune) in the end phase tend to be those with fewer contacts. This will decrease the minimum required level of herd immunity. Furthermore, time could be saved by starting the moments of lifting control earlier, such that local epidemics somewhat overlap. Understanding the complex balance between these three processes (peaky behavior, selection of those with fewer contacts, and partial overlap of local epidemics) requires mathematical modelling.",

For the example in Figure 1 , the model simulates a population of 10 million individuals, living in 10 thousand clusters (towns, wards or villages) that are grouped in 10 about equally sized superclusters (e.g. provinces). The clusters vary in size such that the 95% extremes (i.e. 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles) reflect populations of about 100 to 4000 inhabitants, with the largest 0.2% exceeding 10 thousand. Heterogeneity is introduced by varying individual contact rates (i.e. the combination of contact frequency and transmission probability) according to a distribution such that both 95% extremes represent a 10-fold relative difference. Furthermore, there is some degree of assortative mixing by allowing mean contact rates to vary more than randomly among clusters. As a consequence, the average contact rate is 4 times higher for the 97.5% vs. 2.5% percentile of all clusters. We describe Covid-19 transmission as a standard .

Durations of the exposed and infectious stages are assumed to be 5.5 and 10 days, respectively, similar to a recent modelling exercise. 3 The model further captures three levels of transmission: within clusters (90% weight), within superclusters (5%), and within the entire population (5%). The start of the epidemic is simulated by randomly seeding 10 infections in one supercluster. The average contact rate has been tuned such that the initial exponential increase of Covid-19 cases matched that of a fully homogeneous SEIR model with R0 = 2.5. Intensive control is assumed to start when the epidemic reached a cumulative number of 300 cases per million. Intensive control is modelled as a reduction of the average contact rate, which we have chosen to be 25% of its original value (75% reduction). Lifting control within a supercluster is assumed to lead to contact rates immediately returning to and staying at their original values for the remainder of the simulation. We further assume some degree of isolation of the supercluster that just lifted control by halving its contribution and exposure to transmission at the overall population level. The chosen critical threshold is 10 thousand prevalent infectious Covid-19 cases per million population, corresponding to the above assumed maximum number of IC beds in the Netherlands. Supplement 1 provides a full technical description of the model. Figure 1A shows that with a strategy of a phased lift of control every 90 days across 10 superclusters, the average trend in the overall number of Covid-19 cases remains well under 10 thousand per million. This interval of 90 days is longer than the 80 days used in the example above to account for the peaky behavior. Control was lifted first in the most affected supercluster (i.e. Noord-Brabant province in the Netherlands), as this provided the least risk of exceeding the threshold; the order of subsequent superclusters was random. Further, the interval between lifting control in the first and second supercluster was allowed to be longer (here we chose 120 days) to let the first local outbreak to reach its peak. The fluctuating pattern reflects the 10 successive local outbreaks within superclusters. Individual model runs show some variation, but the overall pattern is very robust. The chosen time schedule for lifting control means that the last supercluster in the country will lift control 840 days (2 years and 4 months) after the first supercluster. On average individuals in the overall population will experience 432 days (about 14 months) of intensive control. Figure 1B illustrates how the superclusters successively contribute to the overall number of Covid-19 cases over time, averaged over the 8 runs. Figure 1C illustrates the change in the proportion of individuals in the four disease states over time. At the end of the epidemic, 56% of the population has become immune. This is somewhat less than the expected 60% when not accounting for heterogeneity and selection of those with the highest contact rates. This selection process is further illustrated in Figure  1D by the initially diverging average relative contact rates for those susceptible and immune, which eventually become 0.70 and 1.24, respectively; the average relative contact rate of infected and immune cases even touches 1.7 in the first phase of the epidemic. A visualization of the simulated spread of Covid-19 between individuals, clusters, and superclusters is available here. [URL follows] Our proposed strategy goes beyond 'flattening' the curve; 3 with our strategy we 'tame' the curve. An important policy-relevant advantage is that instructions to the public will be clear by offering only two regimens: (1) continue the current regulations and recommendations regarding physical distancing and travel restrictions; and (2) permanently return to the normal situation as before Covid-19. This is much more practical than trying to define and achieve a nationwide level of control to not exceed the IC threshold. Also, the strategy to flatten the curve is less efficient because the IC .

Basically, the overall duration of the strategy is determined by the chosen number of subdivisions of the country, with a higher number leading to a longer overall duration but lower prevalent case numbers. The required number of superclusters will depend most on R0 and the chosen maximum number of prevalent Covid-19 cases (dashed horizontal line in Figure 1) . A minimum condition for implementing this strategy is that there is sufficiently intensive control (now assumed to reduce contact rates on average to 25% of their original level) to avoid outbreaks in locations that have not yet lifted control. Notably, under this condition, isolation of the supercluster lifting control is not strictly necessary. Also, our strategy can start at any moment, which allows the health care system to prepare for the lift of control in the first supercluster. We further show that it is not strictly necessary that all individuals return to their normal daily activities; however, if many maintain their reduced contact behavior until the end of the strategy, this may trigger a substantially larger last peak. The strategy may be optimized by using an adaptive approach where the next moment of lifting control depends on the state of the outbreak in the preceding supercluster, which would also allow us to counter unexpected outcomes related to uncertainties in Covid-19 transmission. In turn, data resulting from local outbreaks will reduce such uncertainties and help to further improve the strategy and the model.",

For instance, we realize that the decision about the order of locations to stop interventions will be extremely complex, leading to political debate and possible societal counteractions.

The actual number of Covid-19 cases in the Netherlands is unknown, but may be estimated using data from Germany where intensive contact tracing and testing has been performed in the general population. As of 25 March 2020, Germany had 33 thousand recognized Covid-19 cases of whom 156 died, and the Netherlands had 5560 confirmed cases and 276 fatalities. Assuming that actual case fatality rates in both countries are similar, there are 10.5 Covid-19 cases (276/5560 \u00f7 156/33000) for every recognized case in the Netherlands. Thus, 1 in 168 (16 \u00d7 10.5) of all Covid-19 cases eventually requires IC admission. Third, Covid-19-related IC admissions typically last about 3 to 4 weeks (say 25 days), which is 2.5 times the presumed duration that an individual is infectious/symptomatic (on average 10 days). This leads to an IC capacity threshold in terms of the prevalent number of Covid-19 cases equal to 115 \u00d7 168 \u00d7 10/25 = 7728 per million. We round this up to 10 thousand per million to reflect that Germany probably did not identify all Covid-19 cases.",
