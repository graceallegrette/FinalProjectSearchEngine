However, a 10 failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symp-15 tomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the symptomatic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be 1/100 to 1/1000. This corresponds to approximately 20 10 million presumed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients across the US during the week starting on March 15, 2020. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every three days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with 25 a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to repurpose outpatient time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.",

Regional preparation for the pandemic requires forecasting the growth rate of the epidemic, the timing of the peak, the demand for hospital resources, and the degree to which current policies may curtail the epidemic, all of which benefit from accurate estimates of the true prevalence of the virus within a population [3] . Confirmed cases are thought to be 35 underestimates of true prevalence due to some unknown combination of patients not reporting for testing, testing not being conducted, and false-negative test results. Estimating the true prevalence informs the scale of upcoming hospital, ICU and ventilator surges, the proportion of individuals who are susceptible to contracting the disease, and estimates of key epidemiological parameters such as the epidemic growth rate and the fraction of infections which are sub-clinical. 40 The current literature suggests that the predominant symptoms associated with COVID are fever, cough and sore-throat; that is, patients often present with an influenza-like illness (ILI) yet test negative for influenza [4, 5] . With many COVID patients having a similar presentation as patients with influenza, existing surveillance networks in place for tracking influenza could be used to help track COVID.",

Together this suggests that the 50 true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the US is much larger than currently appreciated and that even the highest symptomatic case detection rates are likely lower than 3% corresponding to approximately 9 million new ILI cases due to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis provides empirical corroboration of previous hypotheses of substantial undocumented cases [6] yet places the estimated undocumented case rate an order of magnitude higher than prior reports [6] . Moreover, these 55 updated prevalence estimates predict that epidemic doubling times greater than 3.5 days [7, 8] would be unable to account for the magnitude of the ILI surge. We test our hypothesis of sub 3-day doubling times in the US by analyzing both state and national COVID surveillance data, finding a broad agreement of doubling time less than 3.5 days in both confirmed COVID case counts and documented COVID deaths. Our findings highlight probable trajectories of the US 60 epidemic and provide evidence for a conceptual model for COVID spread in the US in which more rapid spread than previously reported is coupled with a larger undiagnosed population to give rise to currently observed trends.",

Many states, including Washington, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Colorado, New Jersey, and Louisiana, have had a recent surge in number of non-influenza ILI cases far in excess of seasonal norms. For example, in the second week of March, 2020, Oregon saw 50% higher non-influenza ILI than it had ever seen since the 70 inception of the ILINet surveillance system within the US. We find that with 95% probability approximately 4% of all outpatient visits in Oregon during this time were for ILI that could not be explained by either influenza or the normal seasonal variation of respiratory pathogens. We find that as the seasonal surge of endemic non-influenza respiratory pathogens declines, this excess ILI correlates more strongly with state-level patterns of newly confirmed COVID cases suggesting that 75 this surge is a reflection of ILI due to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearson \u03c1 = 0.8 and p < 10 \u221210 for the last two weeks; Figure S1 ). To equate this surge to state-wide or national case counts, we assume that the average number of patients seen per week by sentinel providers is representative of their respective states that week. Using this assumption, the total excess non-influenza ILI across the US was approximately 9.2 million excess individuals in the week starting March 15th, 2020 compared to 80 the same week in 2019 (95% credible interval of 8.0-10.1 million).",

However, if we assume the excess non-influenza ILI is almost entirely due to SARS-CoV-2, an assumption that becomes more valid as the virus becomes more prevalent, we can use the excess non-influenza ILI to understand the constraints and mutual dependence of exponential growth rates, the rate of subclinical infections, and the time 95 between the onset of infectiousness and a patient reporting as ILI Figure 3 . With a January 15 start date of the US epidemic [9] , allowing early stochasticity from start-time to the onset of regular exponential growth, we find that it's impossible to explain the ILI surge with an epidemic whose doubling time is longer than 3.5-days, as such slow growth scenarios fail to reach the observed excess ILI even when accounting for possible asymptomatic cases. 100 We tested our hypothesized constraint that doubling times across the US would be shorter than 3.5 days by analyzing the doubling time confirmed COVID cases and deaths due to COVID. We find that both confirmed case data and COVID fatality data support our estimated doubling-time bound derived from ILI data. Across the entire US, the doubling rate for deaths due to COVID is 2.520 days (\u00b10.001, p-value of test that doubling rate is less than 3.5 days approximately 0) 105 and the doubling time for confirmed cases is 2.455 days (\u00b10.001, p-value of test that doubling rate is less than 3.5 days approximately 0).

We find a clear, anomalous surge in ILI outpatients during the COVID epidemic that correlates with the progression of the epidemic across the US. The surge of non-influenza ILI outpatients is much larger than the number of confirmed case in each state, providing evidence of large numbers of symptomatic probable COVID cases that remain undetected. Moreover, this 115 excess ILI surge allows us to develop a bound for the slowest epidemic doubling time, and the lowest clinical rate that would still be consistent with the observed surge. We test whether or not observed epidemic doubling times are shorter than our upper-bound and find that the observed doubling time for both confirmed cases and deaths is faster than 3 days within the US. Together, the surge in ILI and analysis of doubling times suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout the 120 US since it's January 15th start date and is likely accompanied by a large undiagnosed population of potential COVID outpatients with presumably milder clinical symptoms than would be thought based on prior studies of SARS-CoV-2+ inpatients.",

Errors in this assumptions would cause proportional errors in our estimated case counts and symptomatic case detection rate. Second, our epidemic models are crude, US-wide SEIR models varying by growth rate alone and as such do not capture regional variation or intervention-induced changes in transmission. Our models were used to estimate growth rates from ILI for testing with COVID 140 data and to estimate the mutual dependency of growth rate, the lag between the onset of infection and presentation to a doctor, and clinical rates; these models were not intended to be fine-grained forecasts for municipality hospital burden and other common goals for COVID models.

Figure 3 : (a) 14,000 random SEIR models predict a range of current number of COVID cases in the US; less transparant trajectories are better agreements with the ILI surge under an assumption that 17% of infections are subclinical [10] . The inset plot shows COVID forecasts comparable to weekly ILI counts (red dots) by summing I(t) over the prior week. A t 2 = 3.5 day doubling time (solid black lines) is the slowest possible growth rate which can account for the observed data with a 4-day lag between the onset of infectiousness and reporting as ILI. Faster doubling times, such as t 2 = 1.6 (dashed black lines) can explain observed ILI data but require a larger rate of subclinical infections to do so. (b) Different growth rates imply different clinical rates in order to account for the excess ILI surge, and the relationship between growth rate and clinical rate varies with the unknown time it takes from the onset of infectiousness to presentation an ILI outpatient. The estimated 2.4-2.5 day doubling times across the US, for example, produce an estimated 3-4% clinical rate.",
