Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus , 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak.",

Originally, infection prevention and control and transmission were grouped separately. However, they were combined as most of the papers in the \"transmission\" category were concerned with transmission to hospital workers. Of note, only 16% of SARS articles were published before the end of the outbreak. Table 2 defines the key clinical research questions identified from each theme. This table was modelled after a publication describing harmonisation of Zika virus protocols [6] .

This allows health care centres in low and middle-income countries to be represented in the data. Global solidarity is needed in the clinical research community as we may face the next pandemic of the 21st century. We all benefit from the data collected and shared.
