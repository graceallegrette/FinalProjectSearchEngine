Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants that can be adapted in response to epidemiological observations, can in certain conditions suppress the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle reduces the reproduction number R by a combination of reduced exposure time and a resonance effect where those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing and extensive testing and contact tracing. Adaptive work-lockdown cycles can provide epidemic control and offer predictability to many economic sectors.",

If a lockdown is successful in reducing the number of critical cases, a decision must be reached on how to exit it. In the absence of herd immunity or vaccine, the main concern is the risk of resurgence of the epidemic. One strategy proposes reinstating lockdown when a critical number of cases is exceeded in a resurge, and stopping lockdown again once cases drop below a low threshold (Kissler et al., n.d.; Ferguson et al. 2020) . While this strategy can prevent the health services from becoming overloaded, it leads to economic uncertainty and continues to accumulate cases with each resurgence (Fig. 1A , S1).",

A strong lockdown as in Wuhan (estimated R~0.3 (C. ) suppresses the epidemic with a 4:10 cycle even if workday R is as large as in the early days of the epidemic in Europe (R~3-4 (Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy, and Others 2020) ).

This requires a low average infection probability per unit time per social contact, q, so that probability of infection, p=1-exp(-qT), does not come close to 1 for exposure time T on the order of days. For COVID-19, an infected person infects on the order of R=3 people on average during the infectious period of mean duration D=4 days. If the mean number of social contacts is C, which is estimated at greater than 10, one has q~DR/C<0.1/day. Thus infection probability on the scale of hours to a few days is approximately linear with exposure time: 1-exp(-qT)~qT. This is consistent with the observation that infected people do not typically infect their entire household, and with the linearity observed in influenza transmission (Cui et al. 2011) . We also tested a scenario using network models in which some contacts have much higher q than others (exponentially distributed q between links).

Governments step in to address these economic challenges and thus government expenditure skyrockets while revenues plummet. The implication of this is growing public deficits. Finally, consumer demand declined precipitously in part because purchases that conflict with the social isolation imperative are viewed by consumers as unsafe or simply banned outright by the government. Moreover, lower employment also means lower aggregate income and therefore consumption. To conclude, the Covid-19 induced crisis has led to an employment and business crisis on the supply side, a suppression of demand and growing government deficits. The longer the lockdown period, the worse these problems will become.",

Considering the well-established research literature on the long-term unemployment scarring effect this has important long-term economic and welfare advantages. First, long-term unemployment (6 months or more) leads to human capital depreciation that in 1 turn reduces productivity, employability and wages (Krebs 2007; Edin and Gustavsson 2008; Davis and von Wachter 2011; Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender 2016) . In instances of widespread unemployment, individual workers decline in productivity and could have an aggregate long-term depressing effect on productivity growth in the entire economy (Carlsson-Szlezak, Reeves, and Swartz 2020) . Long-term unemployment also exerts negative effects on social capital: in this context, the deterioration of social networks that help the unemployed to find appropriate employment opportunities (Machin and Manning 1998) . Adverse physical and mental effects are also associated with long-term unemployment (Nichols, Mitchell, and Lindner 2013) .",

However, this implies running deficits. The cyclic strategy does not mean that the government can simply trust the private sector to pay wages on par with the norm during the pre-crisis era. Given depressed demand, absent government subsidies many businesses would be unable to cover their costs in full, even if workers receive only compensation for part-time work. In addition, without government supplements many families would be unable to make ends meet even assuming that the breadwinners work part time. Nevertheless, the fact that some production would continue implies that the private sector shortfall that the government needs to cover would be smaller than what would be the case under full lockdown. As a result, government's fiscal burden would be lighter under a cyclic strategy than full lockdown mode.",

Services that rely on physical human congregation such as flights, hotels or restaurants are unlikely to operate anywhere near normal under this scheme. Even if governments loosen restrictions on congregation, most people would refrain from patronizing large-scale entertainment events, for example, as long as a substantial perceived Covid-19 health risk is present. Under such circumstances, such businesses may prefer full lockdown anticipating that the 'all clear' signal would arrive earlier than under the cyclic scheme. Unfortunately, full lockdown cannot guarantee that resurgence would not occur. Resurgence would place businesses that are highly reliant on their potential customers' sense of Covid-19 risk/health in a position that is no better, and perhaps even worse (due to costs associated with reopening and closure) than under a cyclic strategy that can prevent resurges.",

Indeed, some production activities are predicated on 'continuous processing/production' in which work interruptions, such as equipment maintenance, are rare. In some cases, shifting from continuous processing to semi-continuous operations would require reorganization of work. In others, cessation of activities comes at high cost due, for example, to undesirable chemical reactions that occur when material flow stops. However, it should be noted, that many of the economic activities to which this issue applies are currently considered by governments as essential (e.g., oil refineries, pharmaceutical plants) and therefore continue to operate almost at full capacity under lockdown mode and would do so under the cyclic scheme as well.",
