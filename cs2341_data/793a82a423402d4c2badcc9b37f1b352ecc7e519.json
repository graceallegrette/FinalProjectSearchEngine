At 12:44 AM GMT on April 3, 2020 the worldwide Covid-19 death toll was reported to be 53,327 with 6,070 of these deaths occurring in the United States. 1 One aspect of this grim situation that has received less attention is the extent to which some of these deaths would have occurred without the viral insult. Noted British statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter was quoted as saying \"Many people who die of Covid would have died anyway within a short period.\" 2 Murray and colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) have predicted that a total of 93,531 (95% UI: 39,966-177,866) Covid-19 deaths will occur in the US by July 15, 2020. 4,5 The projections assume the continuation of full social distancing through the end of May 2020. The IHME death total has received national recognition recently. 6 The goals of our study were to estimate the infection rate (IR) needed to produce the IHME number of deaths based on published infection fatality rates (IFRs), and how many of the deaths would be excess deaths, meaning they would not have occurred when they did or as soon as they did in the absence of SARS-CoV-2.",

The infection curve in South Korea has flattened but it has not in the US. Flaxman, et al, estimated that between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to March 28, 2020 across 11 European countries. This means that 1.88% to 11.43% of the population was infected with an average IR of 4.9%. 18 Lee has suggested that Covid-19 deaths are coded differently than, say, influenza deaths on death certificates. 19 Specifically, in the United Kingdom Covid-19 is a notifiable disease. As a result, any patient who is positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be coded as a Covid-19 death. Conversely, influenza is not a notifiable disease and a person dying with influenza would not necessarily be recorded as an influenza death.",
