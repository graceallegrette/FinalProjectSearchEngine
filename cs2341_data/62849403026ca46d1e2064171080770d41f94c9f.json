            "text": "One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and interstrain polymorphisms.",

In microbes, such diversity is generated in particular by high mutation rates, which may generate both nucleotide substitutions as well as point insertions or deletions (indels) (1) . Longer indels may also occur (2) , as may events of genetic recombination. Disease pathogenesis, progression, management and epidemiology are all affected by the genetic diversity created in microbial populations (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Thus, characterizing this diversity is of utmost importance in clinical as well as research settings, which makes the development and improvement of suitable sequencing technologies crucial (10) (11) (12) . The availability of second-generation DNA sequencing technologies (13) , with the Illumina platform currently at the forefront, has made the sequencing of genomes conventional. In particular, this technology has dramatically furthered the study of viruses, whose relatively small genomes allow in depth characterization of a population of viruses (14, 15) .",

However, Illumina short-read sequencing technologies all share one major limitation, the short length of each read, which typically ranges between 75 and 600 bp (for a paired end read). This means that a complete viral genome sequence cannot be obtained in a single read, impairing the ability to link distant mutations in an individual viral genome. Another Illumina limitation is that RNA cannot be sequenced directly. During library preparation, RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA and amplified by PCR. This creates multiple problems that have been extensively discussed but not resolved (10) : first, reverse transcription and PCR may introduce errors during early stages of amplification that will be carried on to later stages (16) (17) (18) . Second, some molecules may be preferentially amplified over others, a term known as PCR bias. Third, PCR and reverse transcription reactions can often result in chimeric DNA sequences that originate from different molecules (19) (20) (21) . Together, these problems make the inference of haplotypes from PCR-based libraries that are sequenced with Illumina extremely limited.",

Briefly, clonal MS2 stock was propagated from a single plaque that was the precursor of all the evolutionary lines established in this work. We performed 15 serial passages at 37 \u2022 C with two biological replicates (hereby denoted as A and B). The serial passages were performed as follows: 100 ml cultures of naive Escherichia coli C-3000 were grown up to an optical density of OD 600 = 0.4 (corresponding to a density of about 10 8 cells/ml). Each passage was infected with 10 ml of 10 9 phages from the previous passage. The cultures were grown for 16 h at each temperature with shaking, and the E. coli cells were then removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to filtration with 0.22 m filter (Stericup \u00ae Filter, EMD Millipore) to remove any remaining residues. Naive hosts were provided for each passage. The new phage stock was then stored at 4 \u2022 C. Aliquots of these phage stocks were used for measuring the concentration of phages by plaque assay and infecting the next serial passage. We then determined the population frequency of each mutation at passage 1 and passage 15 through whole genome deep sequencing as described below, using Illumina and MinION.",

The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 \u2022 C followed by incubation on ice for 7 min. After brief centrifugation, 4 l of 5X First-Strand Buffer were added along with 1 l DTT (0.1 M), 1 l of RNase OUT (Thermo Scientific) and 1 l of SuperScript\u2122 III RT (200 units/l). The mixture was incubated for 60 mins at 55 \u2022 C followed by inactivation for 15 mins at 70 \u2022 C. The last step was adding 1 l of RNase H to the reaction according to manufacturer instructions. cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction was directly used as a template for the PCR amplification of the full MS2 genome in three overlapping fragments. PCR reactions were performed using 'Phusion High-Fidelity DNA-polymerase' (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions with the primers: 1F (GGGTGGGA CCCCTTTCGG), 1R (TTTTTCTAGAGAGCCGTTGC CT), 2F (GGCCCAAATCTCAGCCATGC), 2R (CGTG TCTGATCCACGGC), 3F (GGCACAAGTTGCAGGA TGCA), 3R (TGGGTGGTAACTAGCCAAGCAG), see Supplementary Figure S6 .

Purified amplicons were quantified with Qubit assays (Q33216, Life Technologies), diluted and pooled in equimolar concentrations. The Illumina Nextera XT library preparation protocol and kit were used to produce DNA libraries, according to manufacturer instructions with some modifications.

This is relaxed later on. (b) Removing proximal positions. Since we observed that positions that are highly proximal (<15 bp apart) often tended to be highly associated, and we suspected this is an artifact of the sequencing machine, chi square results for all such proximal positions were removed from the analysis. to each other tend to present spurious high associations, due to transitivity we expect a position next to a real mutation to also be highly associated with other positions with real mutations. In other words, if positions p and q are highly associated because they are real mutations, and positions q and q + 1 are highly associated because they are proximal, we will see a high association between positions p and q + 1 as well. However, we expect the association between the real mutations to be the highest, i.e. to be a local maximum in the surroundings of a given pair. A normalized chi score's surroundings is defined as the four neighboring normalized chi scores when the data is regarded as a two-dimensional matrix. For example, the normalized chi score for ( p, q) is required to be higher than the normalized chi scores for ( p, q \u2212 1), ( p, q + 1), ( p \u2212 1, q) and ( p + 1, q). (e) Use of a control sequence. In order to create a cutoff for the normalized chi-square statistic, we used the values obtained for a control sequence (Supplementary Figure  S3 ). We know that our control sample was not completely homogenous, since it contained two mutations at a frequency slightly higher than 10%. Nevertheless, it served as a valid control when setting a confidence rate of 99.9%, i.e. calculating the normalized chi score that allows 0.1% of the positions in our control sample to be identified as significant (allowing for three 'false positive' positions in our case). After stages (a) through (e), AssociVar infers n positions with real mutations in the population. The last stage is to identify the identity of the mutations (A, C, G, T, \u2212), in a similar way to that described in (a). Insertions are ignored here. Every position has four possible alternative variants (the three nucleotides that differ from the reference, or a deletion), and we test these variations against each other using chi-square tests, leading to 4n \u00d7 4(n\u22121)",

We then use our inferred 95 percentile error thresholds (Table 1) to deduce which combinations of mutations are likely to be true and which may have been created by the technical error rate. We use an iterative approach to classify which of the 2 n haplotypes is reliable. First, for every single nucleotide variant, we group together all of the haplotypes that include this base variant (a haplotype can appear in more than one group). Second, in each group, we compute the relative frequency of each haplotype as its proportion of all haplotypes in the group. We iterate through the haplotypes from highest frequency to lowest, classifying each haplotype as reliable or not. The first haplotype is automatically classified as reliable. For every haplotype, we compare its relative frequency with the probability that it is created by technical errors from the closest haplotype classified as reliable, called its parent haplotype, using the inferred error threshold. For example, if a haplotype has an additional deletion and substitution when compared to its parent haplotype, we require that its relative frequency be higher than the product of 0.214 \u00d7 0.237 = 0.051 to be classified as reliable (using the 95th percentile error frequencies in Table 1 ). We iterate through the haplotypes until classifying all the haplotypes in each group. If reads for a WT haplotype exist, the WT is also treated as a base for a group -which in this case will include all of the observed haplotypes.

We expect such variants to be the sum of two independent processes: real biological variations derived from evolutionary processes in the phage populations, and technical errors introduced by the sequencing process. Comparing between the variant distributions of Illumina and MinION, it was evident that MinION suffers from a very high technical error rate (Figure 2) . Notably, in the control population the number of variants exceeding a frequency of 1% in the Illumina sequencing was 12, whereas with MinION we observed 8917 variants in 3326 positions exceeding 1%. This allowed us to infer that the vast majority of MinION variant frequencies are technical errors, and further allowed us to roughly estimate the various types of MinION error rates for our experiment (Table 1) . Notably, we observed that the point deletion and point insertion rates together exceeded the substitution rate, reinforcing previous observations (36, 37) . We attempted to use the inferred MinION error rates as thresholds that can distinguish between real mutations from errors, by setting the 95th percentile obtained for the control sample as an error threshold for each type of error (Table 1 ). This na\u00efve approach that is often used, quickly turned out to be invalid, as corroborated by our parallel Illumina results. For example, we knew from the Illumina results that only 6 mutations in line A and 8 mutations in line B exceeded a frequency of 10% at passage 15 ( Figure 1 ). However, the MinION results showed 1168 mutations in 949 positions and 1081 mutations in 879 positions exceeding 10% in both replicas, respectively.",

This led us to realize that random technical errors are expected to display a different pattern than real biological mutations: we expect technical errors to be associated randomly with any other technical error, whereas a pair or more of real biological mutations are expected to be non-randomly associated with each other. This is a reflection of evolutionary processes operating on genomes. While mutations created from replicative polymerases will be mostly randomly distributed along the genome, selection and genetic drift will lead to the fact that specific combinations of mutations reach higher frequency. Thus, true mutations that are prevalent in a population will tend to be either present with some other mutations on the same genome/read, or not present with some other mutation on the same genome.

Notably, this led to ( We began by inspecting all associations between all pairs of positions. This allowed us to make a few general observations. First, we observed that proximal pairs of positions (residing up to 15 bases apart from each other) tended to be highly associated. We postulate that this is a reflection of MinION errors, and also the high deletion rate, which could cause slight misalignment of reads covering positions proximal to the deletions. Second, we observed a very similar pattern of associations among the three samples.

Second, we are interested in inferring haplotypes, i.e. which mutations reside together regularly on the same genomes and which do not. Once again, the high error rate makes this extremely tricky since we observe reads bearing almost all possible combinations of mutations. In fact, most reads bore so many variants, that \u223c15-20% of the bases called per read were different than the reference (Supplementary Figure S5 ). In this case, we used a two-pronged approach: we first focused only on variants inferred as true mutations using our method, AssociVar, as described above. Second, we used the inferred error threshold to infer the probability of two or more variants residing erroneously on the same genome, utilizing an iterative approach in which we compare a given haplotype to haplotypes already classified as reliable (Materials and Methods).

Our approach also shows high specificity, with a false positive rate lower than 0.1%. Finally, we have shown that using a na\u00efve approach based on a frequency threshold as a cutoff to separate real mutations from errors results in extremely high false positive rates, demonstrating the value of our approach.",

This turned out to be only partially true: mutations with similar frequency were sometimes indeed on the same genomes (e.g. T1764-/G3114A), but sometimes completely not (the former two and A1664G) ( Table 2) . These results illustrate the utility of MinION to resolve the relationships among mutations, and its advantage for differentiating variants with mutations displaying similar frequencies.",

This was then precisely verified by Illumina sequencing of the same population. Remarkably, this analysis shows that (a) AssociVar can be used to analyze different types of data, ranging from virus genomes to mRNA of any organism, and (b) AssociVar can be used without sequencing a control sequence. We note that this requires more caution, since our analysis of MS2 showed that spurious associations between mutations may be created artifactually by the sequencing process itself. Use of AssociVar without a control sequence requires the user to specify the threshold of the normalized chi square statistic. As with all methods, the specificity of AssociVar comes at the cost of sensitivity, and vice versa ( Figure 6 ). Nevertheless, it seems the best strategy we can suggest is to use a very high threshold, which is extremely effective for variants at a frequency higher than 5 or 10%.",

            "text": "It is important to delineate the limitations of our approach. We note that we cannot distinguish haplotypes/strains that differ from each other at one position only, because our method relies on the association between two positions containing real mutations. Similarly, if two strains differ at very proximal loci, AssociVar will also fail, since we filter out associations between mutations that are <15 base pairs apart. We postulate that the presumably artifactual associations we observed between proximal loci are induced by the RNA (or DNA) passing through the pore of the sequencer. Finally, we also noted specific patterns of mutations that were reproduced between our control sequence and the two evolved populations of MS2. This suggests two possibilities: first, perhaps sequence context and/or RNA secondary structure induce specific errors in MinION, and second, it is possible that MS2 genomes undergo RNA modifications and these are the cause of these specific errors. MinION direct RNA sequencing records the raw electric signal produced by the RNA going through the pores, and this potentially offers the opportunity to identify RNA modifications using a newly developed tool called Tombo (version 1.5) by Oxford Nanopore (https://nanoporetech.github.io/tombo/). Unfortunately, we could not conclusively determine the presence or effect of RNA modifications and its relationship to associated mutations. Our results suggest that Tombo still suffers from a high false positive rate, while the true positive rate of the method has not yet been determined (38) . The former was demonstrated herein by a high number of presumably modified sites found in the enolase yeast gene, despite the fact this gene was created synthetically in vitro, where modifications would not likely occur. We nevertheless analyzed our MS2 samples and found a similar pattern of presumable modifications among the three MS2 samples, yet there was no correlation between sites with a high rate of modification and sites with high normalized chi scores by AssociVar (see supplementary text, Supplementary Figures S7-S10 ). While we cannot rule out that RNA modifications are responsible for the pattern of errors in MinION, we conclude that further research is required to determine which factors induce these errors.",

When we tried to reconstruct the known haplotypes present in this sample, our method did not fully succeed to recapitulate the haplotypes (data not shown). One possible explanation for this is that during the amplification step, either chimeric sequences of both strains were created, or PCR recombination occurred, breaking down some of the linkage between sites. In such cases, the use of AssociVar is limited to the detection of mutations only, and this further suggests that direct RNA/DNA sequencing may be preferable.",

To make the different positions comparable, we normalized the chi square statistics per position by calculating a modified z-test score z for the chi-square statistic x of each pair of positions ( p 1 , p 2 ). This was done by dividing the difference between x and the median by the median absolute deviation (MAD) and multiplying the result by 0.6745, as follows: z = 0.6745 * (x \u2212 medi an)/MAD. Thus, for each position p 1 we calculated its median and its median absolute deviation across the chi-square statistics for position p 1 and any other position q. This essentially served to test whether some positions display strong outliers in their chi-square statistics (35), as can be seen visually for bona fide mutations displayed in Figures 4 and 5.

Associations marked as red identify positions that are false positives and do not have real mutations according to the Illumina results (one position for p15A and two positions for p15B). The red line illustrates the cutoff defined by the control sequence. Notably, the blue dots above the line are positions near real mutations, removed by AssociVar via the requirement for a local maximum (Materials and Methods).",
