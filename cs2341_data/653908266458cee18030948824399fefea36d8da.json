We observe that till 27 March 2020, the number of infected individuals (I(t)) in USA, Spain, Germany, Iran, France, and India are growing exponentially. On the contrary, I(t) curves for China and South Korea exhibits power law behavior before flattening of the curve. The derivative\u0130(t), which is also the daily infection count, is proportional to I(t) for the exponential regime, but not for the power law regime. These valuable indicators could be used for epidemic forecast. We also argue that long-term community transmission and/or the transmission by asymptomatic carriers traveling long distances may be inducing the power law growth of the epidemic.",

As of 1 April 2020, it has infected nearly a million humans, killed around 41000 individuals, and has brought most of the world to a standstill in lockdowns [1, 2] . A major economic recession is underway. Hence, modeling and forecast of this epidemic is of critical importance. In this letter we analyze the publicly available data set of the epidemic. The data show that countries that have achieved flattening of the epidemic curve exhibit power law growth before saturation. This feature can be used as an important diagnostic for flattening of the curve.",

To account for spatio-temporal behavour, Min et al.

We present the former data in Figure 1 using semi-logy plots with thin red curves, while the latter in Figure 2 using log-log plots with same color convention. In these plots we represent time using dates with month/date; the starting date for each plot is chosen as t = 0. In Table I we present the best fit curves for I(t), along with errors. We have computed the best fit curves using Python's polyfit function, and the error as the relative error between the original data and the fitted data. Figure 2 also contains I(t) for the world, in which the red-colored part is dominated by I(t) from China, and the unfilled region by the new cases from rest of the world.
