This enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus belongs to the Arteriviridae family (order Nidovirales), which also includes the equine arteritis virus, mouse lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [2] . In general, PRRSV infection causes a disease that is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory infections in growing pigs [3] , and this disease predisposes pigs to infection by bacteria and other viral pathogens [4, 5] . This disease is known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and has become endemic in many countries throughout the world following an epidemic phase [6, 7] . Its incidence was first reported in Thailand in 1989, and since then, several outbreaks have been reported [8] . It has become a major infectious disease that causes high mortality in swine and production losses in the swine industry in this country.",

Antiviral therapeutics are a critical tool for combating viral infections, particularly in cases wherein no vaccines are available against the circulating virus. Thus, pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative approach in controlling PRRSV. A number of natural compounds and compositions have been shown to possess antiviral activities against PRRSV. Gao et al. [11] showed that Cryptoporus volvatus extract exhibited antiviral activity against PRRSV infection and replication. Pringproa et al. [12] reported that crude Cynodon dactylon extract significantly inhibited PRRSV replication as early as 24 h post-infection (hpi). Therefore, the antiviral activities of other Thai medicinal plants against PRRSV should also be investigated. Thai medicinal plants such as Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra are known to have antioxidant and antiviral activities. These plants have already been promoted for use in primary health care and have been classified according to their pharmacological actions [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts against PRRSV infection in vitro and to measure their phytochemical contents to develop an alternative anti-PRRSV therapy for use in veterinary medicine.",

The range of plant extract concentrations was determined based on their CC 50 values. P. emblica extract inhibited PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells and in vitro. P. emblica extract at a concentration of 78 \u03bcg/ml inhibited PRRSV infectivity at a virus titer of 4.5 TCID 50 /ml (log 10 ). In this study, P. emblica extract showed the highest cytotoxicity to MARC-145 cells with CC 50 of < 100 \u03bcg/ml. Therefore, the antiviral activity of other plant extracts were investigated in this study. We found that T. triandra extract at a concentration of 1250 \u03bcg/ml significantly inhibited PRRSV infectivity at a virus titer of 3.5 TCID 50 (log10). While T. triandra extract has been used as anti-inflammatory [22] , anticancer [23] , and antimicrobial agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24] , its antiviral activity, particularly against PRRSV, has not been investigated previously. Therefore, this is the first report to indicate that T. triandra extract could significantly prevent the entry of PRRSV into MARC-145 cells. However, T. triandra extract was not found to be effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication. All studied plant extracts could inhibit PRRSV replication when applied at high [13] and the antimicrobial properties of C. sappan [25] have previously been investigated, this is the first study to reveal the inhibitory activity of C. sappan extract on PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells.",

            "text": "Regarding phytochemical content, C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content (220.52 \u00b1 4.47 mM GAE/g sample). The total phenolic content of a plant is considered an indicator of its antioxidant capacity because the redox properties of phenolic compounds allow them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, and radical scavengers [22] . Previously, Lee et al. [26] reported that ethanolic C. sappan extract had a total phenolic content of 723.67 \u03bcg GAE/mg. The values of total phenolic content in this study were slightly Abu-Jafar and Huleihel [27] reported that ethanolic Eucalyptus camaldulensis leave extracts had strong antiviral activity against different members of the herpes virus family (HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV). Ramalingam et al. [28] reported that the ethanolic extracts of Andrographis paniculata have the highest antiviral inhibitory effects against dengue virus in Vero cells. The screening of plants as possible sources of antiviral agents has led to the discovery of potent inhibitors of in vitro viral replication, thereby increasing the probability of identifying new bioactive plant compounds [29] . These findings suggest the appropriate species and concentration of plant extract that could effectively inhibit PRRSV replication, with both T. triandra and C. sappan extracts being highly effective in inhibiting PRRSV infection in vitro by interfering with viral attachment and inhibiting viral replication and/or virus release, respectively. The modes of action of T. triandra and C. sappan extracts against PPRSV require further investigation but are likely to be related to the natural compounds they contain. Therefore, it was speculated that both T. triandra and C. sappan extracts are potential candidates for preventing PRRSV infection in pigs. However, the plant extracts used for testing antiviral activity was crude extracts. In future, we plan to purify the most effective Thai medicinal plant extracts (T. triandra and C. sappan extracts) for screening the active compound that is highly effective against PRRSV.",
