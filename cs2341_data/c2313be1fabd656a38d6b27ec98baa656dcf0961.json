Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory \"cytokine storm\". However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000-45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears not to be present in COVID-19.",

All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited increases in inflammatory parameters ( Table 1) . As of March 27 th 2020, two patients died (at 3 and 4 days post-ICU admission, data of only one timepoint of these patients was recorded), and 22 patients were still in the ICU.

COVID-19 patients exhibited notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients (pink line in Figure 1A , data from [1] , p<0.0001).
