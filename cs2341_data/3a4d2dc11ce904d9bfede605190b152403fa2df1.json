Laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays were conducted to evaluate the attractiveness of synthetic aggregation pheromone lure to lesser mealworm adults and larvae. All components of this synthetic aggregation pheromone lure, including: (R)-(\u03e9)-limonene, (E)-\u2424-ocimene, (S)-(\u03e9)-linalool, (R)-(\u03e9)-daucene, and 2-nonanone were also tested singly. Chicken dropping volatile compounds and fresh chicken droppings (CD) were evaluated singly or in combination with the pheromone lure. In Arkansas, trapping experiments were conducted in different poultry houses with low, moderate, and high lesser mealworm populations to evaluate the attraction of pheromone lure. Laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassay was found to be a useful and convenient tool for evaluating the attractants before testing them in the poultry house. Greater attraction of adults and larvae to a dose of 20 \u00d030 g pheromone lure was identi\u00deed in laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays. Adults and larvae were highly attractive to a combination of fresh CD and pheromone lure, whereas, a combination of chicken dropping volatile and pheromone lure was not signi\u00decantly attractive. The low attraction of limonene and linalool in the laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays suggest that either they are nonattractive or attractive only at a narrow range of concentrations. Higher numbers of lesser mealworm adults and larvae were found in traps treated with pheromone lure as compared with untreated controls in \u00deeld experiments. Results indicate a potential for combining the pheromone lure with the attractive CD compounds to enhance trap ef\u00decacy.",

            "text": "The lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a serious, cosmopolitan pest present in poultry production facilities, where it consumes poultry feed and litter, and causes decreased weight gains in broiler chicks that eat these beetles (Despins and Axtell 1995) . These beetles also transmit several disease agents such as avian in\u00dfuenza, Marek\u00d5s disease, Coronavirus, the Newcastle disease virus (De las Casas et al. 1973 , 1976 , Salmonella typhimurium (McAllister et al. 1994) , Campylobacter jejuni (Strother et al. 2005) , infectious bursal disease (McAllister et al. 1995) , and also cause damage to poultry insulation by tunneling (Despins et al. 1987) . Control of lesser mealworm adults and larvae is mainly through use of contact insecticides, which has resulted in insecticide-resistant strains (Lambkin 2005) . Because of environmental and resistance concerns related to the use of conventional insecticides, research needs to be focused toward other alternative tactics such as attractants, pheromones, kairomones, and other behavior-modifying chemicals.",

            "text": "Attraction of adults to pheromones is well documented in many tenebrionids including the red \u00dfour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Rangaswamy and Sasikala 1991) , the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor L. (Tanaka et al. 1986 ), the broad-horned \u00dfour beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus F. (Tebayashi et al. 1998 , Tashiro et al. 2004 , and the desert tenebrionid beetle Parastizopus transgariepinus Koch (Geiselhardt et al. 2008) . Volatile collections from lesser mealworm males and females revealed four male-speci\u00dec compounds, including: (R)-(\u03e9)-limonene, (E)-\u2424-ocimene, (S)-(\u03e9)-linalool, and (R)-(\u03e9)-daucene (Bartelt et al. 2009 ). A \u00defth compound, 2-nonanone was also iden-ti\u00deed from male, and in small amounts from female lesser mealworms. Synthetic lesser mealworm aggregation pheromone lure referred to hereafter as \"pheromone lure\" composed of these \u00deve compounds was attractive to both sexes in preliminary laboratory pitfall bioassays (Bartelt et al. 2009 ). However, the dosedependent response to pheromone lure, and the attractiveness of individual pheromone lure compo-nents have never been tested to adults and larvae in laboratory conditions. Adult and larval attraction to adult-produced pheromones have been described in codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Duthie et al. 2003) , and T. castaneum (Mondal and Port 1984) . Lesser mealworm adults and larvae are unevenly distributed in poultry houses in clumps or in aggregations (Falomo 1986 ). Adults and larvae placed in a petri dish with wood shavings form tight aggregations suggesting some sort of assembling scent present that leads to their aggregation behavior (Falomo 1986 ). These aggregations also suggest the existence of pheromonal communication among adults and larvae of lesser mealworm. The attractiveness of adult-produced pheromone lure to larvae of lesser mealworm needs to be explored in laboratory and \u00deeld conditions. Successful mass trapping using male-produced synthetic aggregation pheromones and plant co-attractants has been reported for bean weevil, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say), pea leaf weevil, Sitona lineatus L. (Blight et al. 1984) , smaller European elm bark beetle, Scolytus multistriatus (Marsham) (Dickens et al. 1990 ), the coconut Rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros L. (Hallett et al. 1995) , and the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Abraham et al. 2000) . Adults and larvae of lesser mealworm were observed to be attracted to fresh chicken droppings (CD) in a poultry house. Strother and Steelman (2001) reported higher number of lesser mealworm adults and larvae along feed and water lines. This also suggests that the beetles may be attracted to the chicken droppings left behind from feeding birds in addition to their attraction for water and feed. The chicken dropping volatiles (CDV) may act as an attractant to adult and larval lesser mealworm beetles. Studying the interactions between pheromone lure and CDV has an immediate practical signi\u00decance in designing more effective traps. These traps can be used to detect early infestations and to attract and kill lesser mealworm beetles in spot treatments rather than spraying the whole poultry house.",

After bird removal, all the houses remained vacant for 2 wk before a new \u00dfock of broilers was introduced. There were always high numbers of beetles in the poultry houses for two reasons: 1) beetleinfested litter is normally removed from the poultry houses to surrounding pasture \u00deelds during the summer when the outside temperatures are suitable for larval development, adult emergence and adult \u00dfight, and 2) poultry houses are only treated with insecticides during the \u00dfock-free period (2 wk) when the heat inside poultry house is turned off and majority of beetles are either hiding in building structures or hiding deep inside the litter layer. These beetles do not come in contact with insecticides. Savage (1992) speculated that if litter applied is 0.4 km from the poultry house, and the beetle dispersal is random, \u03f760,000 beetles for every one million applied to the \u00deeld would return to the poultry house.

These numbers were based on a 1 d trap catch before starting the experiment. The building was 99 \u03eb 14 m wide with the long axis orientated east to west and was managed to produce six or 8 wk-old broiler chickens, but it did not contain birds at the start of this study. Two automatic feeder lines ran the length of the house, 2 m out from the wall. The \u00dfoor of the house was covered with used pine wood-shaving litter \u03f78 cm deep. Plastic trays (56 \u03eb 34 cm) containing chick feed were placed 2 d before chicks were introduced inside the house. They were used to supplement the automatic feeders so that newly hatched chicks had optimal feed access during the \u00derst 10 d of a production cycle. The trays were located in three parallel lines. One row of trays was located under feed spouts on either side of the permanent feeder pans. The remaining two rows were on either side of the feed line beneath each automatic feeder line and the tray spacing was 1 m. The beetle traps were placed parallel to the feeder lines or feeder pans and were spaced \u03f71 m apart. The experiment was a randomized complete block (RCB) design with four blocks: one and two on the north side of the house and three and four on the south side (Fig. 1) . Each block consisted of two treatments randomly assigned within each block: six traps with pheromone-treated septa; and six traps with untreated (control) septa. Trapping was conducted over three consecutive days from 20 to 23 August 2008. The house temperature was 28\u040aC when the traps were initially placed and baited in the afternoon. The beetles were collected from the traps after 24 h and trap baits were replaced. By then, propane heaters raised the house temperature to 34\u040aC (the rearing temperature of the young birds). After the second 24 h period, trapped beetles were again removed and baits replaced. At this time, 10,000 1-d-old chicks were released into the facility, and once again, beetles were collected from the traps after 24 h. Thus, the beetle response to the treated septa was monitored for 1 and 2 d before chick introduction and for 1 d afterward, and the time period of the study included a de\u00dened temperature change.

Limonene is a monoterpene that is found to be repellent against mealybugs and white\u00dfies (Hollingsworth 2005), and cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus (Canestrini) (Ferrarini et al. 2008) .

Pheromones are usually perceived at minute quantities and elicit strong behavioral and antennal responses. While multiple chemicals and correct blends can be critical for pheromone activity, kairomone activity in general is even more dependent on multiple compounds and correct ratios, and kairomones frequently require more material for activity (Witzgall et al. 2008 , Trona et al. 2010 . The concentration of CDV (kairomone) used was half that of the pheromone lure in the laboratory pitfall bioassays. Therefore, the low concentration of CDV might have accounted for the low attractiveness of CDV to adults and larvae as compared with fresh CD. The low concentration of CDV might not have released the correct natural ratios of different volatile components. Testing CDV at higher doses might have produced a more pronounced response. The fresh CD might have released the volatile pro\u00deles in ratios more similar to those released in the poultry house, and also the larvae and adults perceived the CD volatiles as they do in their natural habitat.",

The presence of chicks affected distribution of beetles, and their droppings strongly competed with the pheromone lure. Nevertheless, a consistent effect of the pheromone over time was observed in low, moderate, and high-infestation houses for adults and larvae. The pheromone effect was consistent over space in moderate and high lesser mealworm infestation houses for adults, and the high lesser mealworm infestation house for larvae. The low larval population or clumped aggregations in the house (Strother and Steelman 2001) might be the reason for the variable attractiveness of pheromone over space for adults in a low infestation house, and for larvae in low and moderate infestation houses.",

Bray et al. (2010) demonstrated the practical application of pheromones in experimental chicken sheds, where the addition of the synthetic pheromone (\u03ee)-9-methylgermacrene-B resulted in greater numbers of male and female sand \u00dfy, Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Neiva being caught and killed with sprayed insecticide, compared with pheromone-free controls.",
