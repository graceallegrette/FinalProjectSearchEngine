China has been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In this article we discuss China's practice in public reporting and its implications to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates. Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and surveillance.",

Up to date, the outbreak has already been spread to 37 countries worldwide and a total of 2918 cases have been confirmed, 287 recovered, and 43 cases died [4, 5] . Had it not for the whole society effort led by the Chinese government, the situation would be much worse in China and around the world. For better global actions, there is a urgent need for public reporting among Nations and further global surveillance.",

Scientifically framed epidemic information about the outbreak can help people understand the developing situation, encourage the whole society to work together against the epidemic, and help prevent data from deliberate misinterpretation. In theory, all relevant information can be reported to support decision making, while such approach takes a lot of time and make it impossible to do so. Therefore, for timely public reporting, selecting the most representive indicators are of most importance. China is the first country to fight the outbreak and have accumulated lots of exprience. Its experience to report the indictors information to the public on daily basis is very useful not only for the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen global surveillance, but also for other countries to improve their public reporting.",

These data together with the updates from the WHO have provided good basis for visual reporting at city, provincial, national, and international levels. Ratio analyses such as case fatality rate, recovery rate, etc. are applied to reflect the whole progress of various effort and interventions. These rates are further classified as Hubei, outside Hubei, whole China, etc. for comparison in curves. It should be noted that there are lots of influential factors affecting the fatality and recovery rates [8] , for example, the fatility rate in Hubei is much higher than other provinces (4.03% vs 0.80%, by Feburuary 27, 2020), which can be partly explained that, even though Hubei is abundant of health resources, but still lacks enough medical resources to provide timely and effective treatments to the hug number of patients compared with much less patients in other Chinese provinces.",

Including up to date incidence and case mortality rate of the coronavirus infections based on the total population will help the general public better assess the impact and reduce overreacted social panic. (4) . For public reporting, countries especially those with suspected and confirmed cases of the COVID-19 should actively report to the WHO for further collaborations. Further relevant technical supports are required to construct a visual reporting system, with data and information coming from government daily updates and social media. (5) . It is important for other countries to timely share the indicators information with the WHO, and a global visual surveillance system is increasingly required, together with current modules in daily situation report, travel advice, technical guidance, and global research [9] .",
