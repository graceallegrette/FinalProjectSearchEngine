            "text": "The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the effects of alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP), two group sizes, and their interaction on nursery pig performance to serve as a model for future AGP alternative studies. A 41-d experiment was conducted in a commercial weanto-finish barn; 1,300 piglets weaned at 21 d of age (weaned 2 or 4 d prior to experiment; 6.14 \u00b1 0.18 kg BW; PIC 1050 sows and multiple sire lines) were blocked by sire, sex, and weaning date, then assigned to eight treatments: four dietary treatments each evaluated across two group sizes. The four dietary treatments were: negative control (NC), positive control (PC; NC + in-feed antibiotics), zinc oxide plus a dietary acidifier (blend of fumaric, citric, lactic, and phosphoric acid) (ZA; NC + ZnO + acid), and a Bacillus-based direct-fed-microbial (DFM) plus resistant potato starch (RS) (DR; NC + DFM + RS). The two group sizes were 31 or 11 pigs/pen; floor space was modified so area/pig was equal between the group sizes (0.42 m 2 /pig). There were 7 pens/diet with 11 pigs/pen and 8 pens/diet with 31 pigs/pen. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with pen as the experimental unit. Diagnostic assessment of oral fluids, serum, and tissue samples was used to characterize health status. Pigs experienced natural challenges of acute diarrhea and septicemia in week 1 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in weeks 4-6. There was a significant interaction between diet and group size for ADG (P = 0.012). PC increased ADG in large and small groups (P < 0.05) and ZA increased ADG only in large groups (P < 0.05). Small groups had improved ADG compared to large groups when fed NC or DR diets (P < 0.05). Similarly, PC increased ADFI (P < 0.05). Compared to NC, ZA improved ADFI in large groups only (P < 0.05; diet \u00d7 group size: P = 0.015). Pigs fed PC had greater G:F than NC (P < 0.05), and small groups had greater G:F than large groups (P < 0.05). There was no effect of ZA or DR on G:F. Pigs fed PC required fewer individual medical treatments than NC and pigs fed ZA were intermediate (P = 0.024). More pigs were removed from large than small groups (P = 0.049), and there was no effect of diet on removals (P > 0.10). In conclusion, careful study design, protocol implementation, sample collection, and recording of important information allowed us to characterize the health status of this group of pigs and determine treatment effects on growth performance and morbidity.",

            "text": "Consumer interest in pork raised without antibiotics or with limited antibiotics and the introduction of the Veterinary Feed Directive in the United States have encouraged producers to look for alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in feed. There are many products already available that may be considered alternatives to AGP. However, the efficacy of AGP alternatives in commercial pork production has not been clearly defined, and the results of AGP alternative studies are often inconsistent (Jacela et al., 2009 (Jacela et al., , 2010 Thacker, 2013; Liao and Nyachoti, 2017) . This may be due to inconsistent experiment methodology, including differences in health status, genetics, experimental conditions, and diet composition (Allen et al., 2013) . This leaves a significant gap in knowledge about the effectiveness of AGP alternatives and the ability to make comparisons or observe trends across studies. To most efficiently identify useful AGP alternatives and apply them in production, it is necessary first to increase the consistency with which studies evaluating AGP alternatives are conducted. Therefore, there is a need for an example protocol with guidelines for AGP alternative studies.",

The pigs were selected from a study evaluating sire lines, thus explaining the larger than normal number of sires represented in the experiment. All pigs used in the experiment came from the same sow source and were weaned at 21 d of age. On day 1 after birth, all pigs were given iron and gentamicin injections. Before weaning, pigs were treated on an individual basis with injectable antibiotics (gentamicin, ceftiofur, or enrofloxacin) as needed. At weaning, pigs were vaccinated for porcine circovirus type 2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Circumvent PCV-MG2, Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ), and ileitis (Porcilis Ileitis, Merck Animal Health). Due to the flow schedule at the sow source, approximately half of the pigs were weaned 4 d prior to the start of the experiment and held at the sow farm while the other half was weaned 2 d prior to the start of the experiment. For the duration of the experiment, pigs were housed in a tunnel-ventilated barn. Each pen was equipped with a 4-space automatic dry selffeeder and nipple water drinker, fully slatted concrete floors, and metal rod penning and gates. Pigs were given ad libitum access to feed and water for the duration of the experiment. An automatic feeding system (Big Dutchman, Holland, MI) was used to deliver a specified amount of feed to each pen. Air temperature in the room averaged 28.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.4, 28.7 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.2, 27.1 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.5, 24.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1.1, 25.8 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.9, 26.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 2.2, in weeks 1-6, respectively.",

            "text": "Experimental treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with four dietary treatments evaluated across two group sizes. The dietary treatments included a negative control (NC) with no AGP, a positive control (PC) consisting of the NC diet with either chlortetracycline hydrochloride (phase 1 and 3) or tiamulin hydrogen fumarate (phase 2) added at the expense of corn, alternative diet 1 (ZA) consisting of the NC diet with zinc oxide (ZnO) plus a dietary acidifier (blend of phosphoric, fumaric, citric, and lactic acids; Kem-Gest, Kemin, Des Moines, IA) added at the expense of corn, and alternative diet 2 (DR) consisting of the NC diet with a Bacillus-based directfed microbial (DFM; BioPlus 2B, Chr. Hansen, Hoersholm, Denmark) plus resistant potato starch (MSP[RS], MSP Starch Products Inc., Carberry, Manitoba, Canada) added at the expense of corn. Combinations of AGP alternatives were used, rather than single products, to first help satisfy the objective of testing a study design, rather than focusing on evaluating specific products. The specific combinations were chosen based on results from Schweer et al. (2017a) which indicated that AGP alternatives in the categories of zinc/copper, organic acids, and probiotics were most effective. Furthermore, ZnO with an acidifier and a probiotic with a prebiotic likely have modes of action which either compliment or do not antagonize each other. Diets were fed in three phases (Tables 1 and 2) based on a feed budgeting system. When a pen consumed its entire allowance for a phase, feed for the next phase was given to that pen. In this manner, all pens were allowed to consume their entire budget for each phase before moving to the next phase. In order to associate pig weights with phase changes, weigh days were scheduled as close as possible to the first pens finishing their feed budget from the previous phase. Phase 1 was fed from days 0 to 11, phase 2 from days 12 to 24, and phase 3 from days 25 to 41.The first two phases were delivered in pelleted form, and the third phase feed was delivered as a mash. Feed was manufactured at two different commercial feed mills (phases 1 and 2 at the same mill, and phase 3 at another mill). Prior to diet manufacturing, the acidifier, ZnO, DFM, and RS products were hand-weighed on an analytical scale to the proper inclusion level, packaged in individual bags, and delivered to the commercial mill. Mix sheets used during mixing from both feed mills were validated after mixing to ensure that these bags were added to the proper batches. In all phases, the diet containing the DFM was mixed last in order to avoid contamination of the other three diets.",

Not counting the space occupied by each feeder, large pens had 0.41 m 2 per pig, and small pens had 0.42 m 2 per pig. Sixty pens were utilized for a total of 15 replicates of each diet (eight large groups and seven small groups each), 32 replicates of large groups and 28 replicates of small groups. Pigs were assigned to blocks based on weaning date, sire line, and sex. Pigs held for 4 d or 2 d post-weaning were balanced within block to account for the potential influence of days post-weaning. Since four different sire lines were used, sire line was balanced within block. Mixedsex pens were used, and sex was balanced within block. A total of 8 blocks were used, and pens were assigned to experimental treatments so that each combination of diet and group size was represented in each block.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of AGP alternative diets and test group size on nursery pig performance. These data can then 4 Removals calculated as total number of pigs removed from study (found dead or removed for illness or injury) divided by number of pigs allotted to pen (31 or 11). 5 Means within a row without a common superscript differ significantly (P < 0.05). Interaction P value for medical treatments and removals not significant. (P > 0.10). be used to provide a better framework of standards that can be used as a model for future studies testing the efficacy of AGP alternatives that will aid in comparing and interpreting results across those studies. The majority of published studies evaluating alternatives to AGP have been conducted in academic research settings, and consequently, most studies have used relatively small groups of pigs (Schweer et al., 2017a) . The literature review conducted by Schweer et al. (2017a) showed that experiments with a positive response to an AGP alternative had, on average, more pigs per pen than studies that did not show a positive response. The observed interactions between diet and group size indicate that consideration of group size may be necessary in studies evaluating AGP alternatives. Improvements in performance due to the ZA diet were only detected when pigs were housed in large groups. Higher removal rates were observed when pigs were housed in large groups, possibly indicating a higher-stress environment. These results may suggest a greater potential for this combination of additives to be effective under higher-stress situations, which may occur in larger group sizes. Furthermore, the benefit of AGP seemed smaller when pigs were housed in small groups. Small groups fed the NC and DR diets had increased ADG compared to large groups. The PC and ZA diets seemed to somewhat compensate for slower gain in large groups as small and large groups had similar ADG when fed these diets. Improved growth performance when pigs are housed in smaller groups is in agreement with previous reports of this trend in nursery pigs (Wolter et al., 2000 (Wolter et al., , 2001 . McGlone and Newby (1994) also reported higher morbidity rates in pens of 40 pigs compared to pens of 10 or 20. These results indicate that group size may impact the outcomes of AGP alternative studies, and perhaps positive responses to specific AGP alternatives are less pronounced in studies where pigs are housed in smaller groups. The growth-promoting effects of subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics in swine diets are well documented (Cromwell, 2002) . Improvements in ADG, ADFI, and G:F observed in this study due to AGP inclusion are similar in magnitude to previous reports (Cromwell, 2002) . The current improvements are higher than the values reported by Dritz et al. (2002) which could be due to the poor performance of the NC treatment, perhaps due to health status. It should also be noted that the chlortetracycline inclusion level in the present diets is higher than some previous studies have used, but the levels of antibiotics used in this study were compliant with the 2017 VFD for this particular farm. Separately, ZnO and acidifiers have shown beneficial effects, yet results have been inconsistent; few studies have looked at these in combination. Pharmacological levels of Zn have also proven effective in improving growth performance of nursery pigs, in addition to decreasing diarrhea (Pettigrew, 2006; Heo et al., 2010; P\u00e9rez et al., 2011; Pluske, 2012) . Walsh et al. (2007) and Li et al. (2008) both reported improvements in growth performance of nursery pigs due to acidifiers, though Boas et al. (2016) reported no improvements. Schweer et al. (2017a) reported that acidifiers resulted in ADG improvements in 33.8% of studies.",

Based on the standard feed budget used at this farm, expected feed intake during phase 3 would be 1.0-1.2 kg/ pig/day. Pigs consumed, on average, only 0.52 kg/ pig/day during this period. Compared to estimates from NRC (2012) for 11-25 kg pigs, the pigs gained 46% less and ate 45% less per day. However, in phases 1 and 2, prior to the PRRSV outbreak, pigs performed as expected (0.212 kg/day compared to the 0.21 kg/day estimate for 5-7 kg pigs, and 0.31 kg/day compared to the 0.34 kg/day estimate for 7-11 kg pigs; NRC, 2012). Severely reduced feed intake and low growth rate demonstrates the impact of the PRRSV challenge on growth performance, which is typical for pigs challenged with this virus (Schweer et al., 2017b) . The present results were likely influenced by this health challenge, especially in phase 3 when pigs were consuming far less feed than expected and therefore were not receiving the desired amount of the AGP alternatives, potentially decreasing their effect.",

Some studies have shown the potential for AGP alternatives to mitigate a health challenge (Bhandari et al., 2008; Gebru et al., 2010; Heo et al., 2010) ; benefits of AGP alternatives to animal health during a disease challenge would be of great interest to the swine industry. Thus far, the impact of specific AGP alternatives in the presence of particular pathogens is not well understood, and information about health status is mostly absent in published AGP alternative studies (Schweer et al., 2017a) . Documentation of the pathogens present in a group of pigs that may influence the outcome of a study will help to build an understanding of how AGP alternatives may perform under varying health conditions. In this study, the collection of oral fluid and serum samples as well as necropsies of pigs that died allowed for the identification or exclusion of critical pathogens, including PRRSV, as influential factors in this group of pigs. Collection and testing of diagnostic samples, especially at the beginning and end of a study, can be used to assess and document pathogen exposure. If clinical signs of illness are observed, additional samples should be collected, based on the symptoms, to characterize the illness. Major changes in health status throughout a trial should be reported. Table 7 outlines examples of potential pathogens of interest and methods of testing for them.",

In this study, analysis of feed samples for Bacillus spore counts revealed that a Bacillus product was included in the vitaminmineral premix that was used in the phase 1 and 2 diets. Thus, the phase 1 and 2 diets all had greater spore counts than expected. Additionally, the spore counts in all the phase 1 and 2 diets were unexpectedly variable, and overall recovery was low (ranging from 20% to 50% in phase 1 and 2 diets; DR diets had an average recovery of 23% in phases 1 and 2). This made it difficult to determine if the DFM product was correctly added to the DR diets. It was clearer that the DFM product was added correctly in the phase 3 diets, although recovery of the product was not as high as expected (roughly 30%) and may also point to variability or low recovery of the Bacillus assay in general.",

Zinc levels in the ZA diets were slightly lower than expected but were much higher in the ZA as intended (Table 1) . When considering the RS content of the potato starch product (approximately 78%, DM basis), the DR diet in phases 1 and 2 showed only 62% recovery of expected values of RS. Since these were pelleted, the low recovery could be due to heat and water application during the pelleting process, which can cause starch to gelatinize and increase its susceptibility to degradation by alpha-amylase (Svihus and Zimonja, 2011) . When possible, it is crucial to analyze diets for the AGP alternatives being tested to confirm their presence as intended, as these outcomes can influence the interpretation of study results.",

Though group size may be an important consideration in AGP alternative studies as previously discussed, it does not appear that a larger sample size would necessarily be needed for one pig group size over the other. In conclusion, the methodology used in this study resulted in the ability to compare the impact of dietary treatments on growth performance, morbidity, and medical treatments to establish a description of population health status. This was facilitated by careful planning and execution of the experimental protocol as well as strict record keeping and observation. The results suggest that group size is an important factor to consider when designing and interpreting AGP alternative studies. As research on AGP alternatives continues, the credibility and impact of future studies will be improved with proper design, protocol implementation, and consistent reporting of pertinent study information and results. Careful consideration of group size, sample size, the study components mentioned above, and how these factors may influence study outcomes will be advantageous to the swine industry's rate of progress in identifying effective alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics.",
