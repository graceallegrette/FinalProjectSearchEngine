In addition, 'spring festival travel', especially train transportation, greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus. 10 Therefore, it is necessary to explore specific features of COVID-19 in areas outside Wuhan.

More formidably, doctors serving in these centres may behave less vigilantly, with lower levels of protective personal equipment compared with those doctors working in clinics serving those with fevers, unknowingly putting the GI practitioners under high exposure risk.

In detail, of 74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 53 patients had only the symptom of diarrhoea, 11 patients had only the symptom of vomiting and 10 patients had only the symptom of nausea. In addition, only three patients had all the GI symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea, while four patients had the symptoms of both nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea was the most common GI symptom in this study and accounted for 8.14% of the total enrolled 651 patients with COVID-19, which was higher than the rate of 3.8% reported previously. 14 Of 53 patients with COVID-19 with diarrhoea, the median duration period was 4 days (IQR: 3-6 days), with the shortest duration of 1 day and longest of 9 days. Most diarrhoea was self-limiting. The average age of the patients with GI symptoms was 46.14\u00b114.19 years and the male:female ratio was 1:1. There were no coexisting conditions of cancer, chronic renal disease, pregnancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunosuppression. Thirty-eight (51.35%) patients had a Wuhan exposure history and 32 (43.24%) patients had a history of contact with patients with COVID-19. Intriguingly, the rate of chronic liver disease was 10.81% in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, which was significantly higher than that of 2.95% in those without GI symptoms (p=0.004). More importantly, the rate of the severe/critical type was also markedly increased in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms than in those without GI symptoms (22.97% vs 8.14%, p<0.001). Family clustering is another pivotal phenomenon of COVID-19. We identified that 23 (31.08%) patients with GI symptoms had family clustering, which was prominently higher than that in patients without GI symptoms (20.45%, p=0.037).

The results of the potential methylation sites of S protein sequences of SARS, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 indicated that there were significant differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS. These coronaviruses can infect host cells through using the S protein to bind to the host cell surface receptor ACE2. During virus maturation, S proteins are glycosylated and divided into the parts S1 and S2. S1 is spherical and mainly involved in the recognition and binding of viruses to host cells. S2 is stalked and able to promote the fusion of the virus into host cells. The comparison results of three virus strains showed that ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 had one high-confidence site, two moderate-confidence sites and four low-confidence sites. SARS has three high-confidence sites, three moderate-confidence sites and five low-confidence sites. From the perspective of high-confidence sites (figure 1A, red arrow), the potential methylation points of SARS-CoV-2 (n=1) and SARS (n=3) are predominantly concentrated in the S1 and S2 segments of the S protein. The positions of two low-confidence sites and one medium-confidence site on S2 are relatively fixed among the three virus strains (blue arrow). These results suggest that the S proteins of the two viruses may have structural and functional differences due to m 6 A methylation during transcription and translation. Additionally, the results of gene sequence alignment ( figure 1B) showed that the variation in S protein sequences between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 was subtle, and these variations were highly concentrated in the S2 segment. These variations resulted in five amino acid substitutions and two amino acid deletions. However, from the perspective of the simulated threedimensional protein structure, the effect of these variations on the overall S protein structure is relatively limited. The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS is significant, especially at the specific recognition point position in segment S1 (figure 1C, red circle). On the one hand, this change may affect the viral binding force on host cells. On the other hand, the electrostatic changes between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 are largely concentrated in the mutation zone of S2 (figure 1C, green ellipse), where the detailed mechanisms need further exploration.",

An endeavour has been made by scientists to reveal the epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 with over 30 publications published in PubMed by 5 February 2020. 2 4-7 Nevertheless, most of these studies focused on the situation in Wuhan, China. In addition, the initiative for SARS-CoV-2 screening started from fever clinics, while fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most emphasised symptoms, which increases the risk of omitting those patients with other symptoms and normal body temperature. It is theoretically plausible that one characteristic of a viral spread is an increased transmission capacity at the cost of decreased virulence, which is also true for SARS-CoV-2. 15 Therefore, caution should be exercised for suspected patients with COVID-19 who had normal body temperatures and visited various outpatient clinics for non-respiratory symptoms. The suspected patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, should be seriously considered, since accumulated evidence supports SARS-CoV-2 transmission through faeces 11 and tears 16 and its ability to bind to ACE2 of the GI tract has been identified. 9 12 In this study, we reported the epidemiological, clinical and virological features of 74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms from Zhejiang province. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the situation of patients with COVID-19 GI symptoms and is the largest group of cases outside Wuhan. Our novel findings are valuable for disease prevention by emphasising suspected patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms and their specific clinical characteristics.",

More importantly, nationwide data showed GI symptoms in 8.7% of 1099 confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2, 14 reinforcing our data. All these data indicated that there were symptom changes in patients with COVID-19. We suspect that SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute gastritis and enteritis, as evidenced by the vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. Since previous studies indicated high ACE2 expression in the GI tract, we envision that such a change indicates the potential of virus mutation towards increased transmissibility, decreased virulence and multiorgan infection, as reflected in the clinics of increased R0 and infection routes. Taken together, the patients with COVID-19 showed an increased tendency to present with GI symptoms in dissemination, increasing infection risk in healthcare providers who were treating suspected patients with COVID-19 without respiratory symptoms and fever.",

We suspect that GI symptoms may cause patients with COVID-19 to be more prone to electrolyte disturbance, such as significantly decreased serum sodium levels (p=0.016), and hence they trend towards the severe/critical type of the disease. Other reasons should be considered and explored based on future data. In addition, the higher rates of familial clustering may be related to faecal shedding in shared toilets in households. Further multivariate analysis revealed sputum production from infected areas and increased LDH/glucose levels as independent risk factors for the disease. In addition, symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath and headache were also significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, which may be caused by their higher fevers and increased electrolyte imbalance. Liver damage should be carefully monitored, as we found significantly increased AST levels and coexisting conditions of liver disease in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms. Since the ratio of chronic liver disease was higher in patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, it could lead to increased levels of ALT and AST. Although there were no significant differences in glucocorticoid and antibiotic therapy between patients with COVID-19 with and without GI symptoms, they were both lower than their counterparts in Wuhan, 4 showing our own experience in effective therapy.",

Using in-depth bioinformatics analysis of the novel identified SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Zhejiang province, we identified many m 6 A methylation sites in the S1 segment of ZJ01 and S2 segment of SARS, indicating that the S proteins of the two viruses may have structural and functional differences due to m 6 A methylation. The addition of chemical modifications is critical to many steps of mRNA processing and fate regulation, while the most abundant internal modification is N 6 -methyladenosin. 19 20 Given the wide prevalence of m 6 A modification on cellular mRNA, it is not surprising that a number of viruses contain m 6 A in their RNA. 21 22 The function of m 6 A methylation on viruses may be diverse with both proviral and antiviral roles. 23 24 Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses containing the largest single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a length between 25.5 and 32 kb. 25 In contrast to previously reported m 6 A modification in viruses, methylation at the N7 position of the 5'-cap structure of coronavirus RNA is commonly identified, which facilitates viral RNA escape recognition by the host innate immune system. 26 Therefore, our findings on the novel m 6 A methylation situation in SARS-CoV-2 may provide a novel mechanism for further study.",

Third, cytokine storm is common in coronavirus 28 and reported in a previous SARS-CoV-2 study 5 ; thus, it would be better if we could also detect cytokine changes in this study. Fourth, it will have more clinical relevance to propose an effective strategy for identifying patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms who lack the typical symptoms such as fever and cough in the early stage. According to our experience, we should pay more attention to exposure history and family clustering during the screening process. Fifth, it would be meaningful to investigate the correlation between the viral genome and GI symptoms. Finally, since over 50% of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the faeces according to one study, 29 the prevalence of viral RNA from faeces samples in patients with GI symptoms should be compared with those in patients without GI symptoms in the future. Moreover, because of the relatively low detection rate for virus in the stool (three of nine patients with COVID-19 positive in our hospital) and rare stool samples were re-tested for the virus in patients after their recovery in this study, it is difficult to evaluate the implications of faecal-oral transmission, so this needs further investigation.",
