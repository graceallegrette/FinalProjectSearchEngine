We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) between hospitals within NHS trusts, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We coarse-grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. Estimates of weekly ICU demand can be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion-to-ICU likelihood estimates, and through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy. The cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases nationally in a single step of the algorithm -leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.",

It is expected that the ICU demand of several hospitals across the UK will surpass their nominal capacity, as is already happening in Spain [8] . The shortage of sanitary resources is unlikely to be limited to ICU units or ventilators, and other resources will face similar challenges. In anticipation of these scenarios, here we design and implement a simple and flexible load sharing procedure which we hope can help to alleviate the level of stress of healthcare systems and implement and test with information for the UK National Health Service (NHS). As a proof of concept, we focus on the problem of ICU demand and propose a routine strategy to transfer patients across the network. Similar strategies can also be followed to transfer ventilators and other resources.",

This result is easy to interpret: there is not an enormous gain in being able to share loads to different receptors (vs one receptor), because on average this possibility will only be useful in a handful of cases. In other words, this result is a byproduct of artificially imposing a uniform-load. Something different is expected to happen if the initial demand on each node is not uniform. Suppose, for instance, that we have a few trusts that are extremely overwhelmed, and could in principle share loads with several receptors (more than one available receptor in its topological neighborhood), but suppose that those receptors are small trusts with only a small number of available ICU beds. In that case, a single-share approach is clearly deficient, but a multiple-share approach could indeed provide a notable improvement. We illustrate this case in the following section.",

Under this scenario, it is important to devise strategies to share the distributed capacity of hospitals: not only in terms of the number of ICU beds, as a matter of fact this is extensible to the overall capacity (critical care, acute capacity, number of ventilators, etc). Here we have detailed an algorithm and implementation for load sharing at the level of NHS trusts. All data and codes, as well as further versions, are and will be available at https://github.com/lucaslacasa/loadsharing . We have presented a proof of concept algorithm and implementation and showed that this procedure works well and can de-collapse the whole NHS network for a range of scenarios. The random search optimisation layer allows to explore non-intuitive load sharing configurations which go beyond the trivial solution to share load with the neighbor with highest capacity, a strategy which might be locally optimal but also might be leading to a global response far away from the global optimum.

In the latter scenario, planning needs to further take into account not only baseline ICU capacity, but overall capacity, also factoring in the estimated lag between admission to hospital and necessity of ventilator, which for COVID-19 is currently estimated at about 2 to 3 days. In a similar vein, note that this work considers the transfer of ICU patients, however a similar approach could be followed if the load to be shared is not patients but ventilators (the units to be shared are not ICU patients but ventilators, so transfer simply happens in the opposite direction, from receptor to origin). Assuming the receptor has both room and personnel to handle additional ventilators, this alternative would indeed eliminate the burden on transferring highly unstable patients and the associated resources required to make such transfers.",

First of all, the baseline ICU demand does not take into account surge capacity, that is expected to significantly increase the real ICU capacity of each trust. Also, the optimisation process implemented here is based on a stochastic search and as such there is no guarantee that the suggested configuration is the global optimum. Other refined methods such as hill climbing, genetic algorithms or simulated annealing can be used. Finally, we have assumed that the number of ambulances or the human resources are not a constraint, and that there are enough vehicles to transfer ICU patients effectively and enough qualified personnel to handle them. All these limitations can easily be addressed by suitably extending the specifications of the algorithm.",
