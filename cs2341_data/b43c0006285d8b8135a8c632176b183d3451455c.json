At the time of preparing this manuscript, we became aware of a similar study conducted in comparing 2019-nCoV proteome with SARS CoV immunogenic peptides 8 . Our in silico approach takes the search beyond presenting only common immunogenic peptide between SARS and 2019-nCoV and provides the experimental community with a more comprehensive list including de novo and cross reactive candidates. On the other hand, considering the fact that two studies have been accomplished independently with distinct approaches, this serves to demonstrate a high level of confidence in reproducing the results. Reproducibility of computational prediction is always of high importance and becomes even more significant under urgent scenarios as of this outbreak.",

Karapetyan et al. have recently provided data from three experimental assays reflecting Binding, Activating and Killing upon each mutation at each position of all possible 9-mers using these three datasets. In a similar way to the original paper, we trained three Position Weight Matrices named B, A and K respectively from Binding, Activating and Killing assay.

Moreover, using combinatory approaches, modelling HLA and TCR binding, they identified 13 peptides potentially able to bind a given TCR in HLA A2 restriction fashion, and cutting a list of peptides able to bind several HLA alleles and characterizing several peptides that may be de novo candidates or crossreactive peptides to be used either to study immune response to 2019-nCoV or to set a vaccine.",

In the absence of patient samples, such approaches are instrumental to guide towards quick and efficient identification of vaccine candidates. The authors used 10 open reading frame sequences of 2019-nCoV deposited at NCBI and conducted sequence alignment against immunogenic peptides deposited in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) database. They identified 28 peptides with sequences matching exactly to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV), that have previously been characterised as immunogenic by T cell assays. These findings are very promising and have the added benefit of potentially developing a vaccine against both SARS and COVID-19.Additional peptides were identified to most likely bind common Chinese and European HLA alleles and have high immunogenicity potential. The authors provide a shortlist of peptides as potential vaccine candidates. While this manuscript presents a good model for identifying such targets, a comment should be included in the discussion about the necessity of expanding the analysis to include wider HLA allele types, considering that the virus is likely to spread worldwide.Minor comment: Please explain the methods and analysis in greater details, including the following terms: 'Towards target peptide length > 3'.'Normalized alignment scores' (and their scale, such as the significance of 4 for the data presented in Figure 1 ).The importance of leucine (L) and valine (V) in anchor positions for MHC binding (for data presented in Table 5 ).",
