            "text": "The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of meloxicam (MEL) as supportive therapy for calves with neonatal calf diarrhea complex. For this double-blind controlled trial, 62 Holstein male calves were purchased at birth and transported to a research facility. At the naturally occurring onset of diarrhea, defined as the first occurrence of a fecal score greater than 2 on a 4-point scale, calves were enrolled in the study. Each calf with diarrhea was randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of MEL at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg of BW or an equal volume of placebo (PLA) solution. Milk, starter ration, and water intakes were determined daily for each calf from arrival until 56 d of age. The calves were weighed on arrival and each week thereafter. Time to weaning and weaning weight were recorded for each calf. Crude associations between treatment and each outcome variable were examined using t-tests and Pearson chi-squared tests. Subsequently, multivariable regression models were constructed to examine the impact of MEL therapy on meaningful outcome variables. The primary experimental unit in all analyses was the individual calf. In total, 56 calves presented with clinical signs of diarrhea and were enrolled in the study. Two PLA-treated calves died after being enrolled in the study, and there was no calf mortality among the MEL-treated calves. For calves that developed diarrhea after 10 d of age, MEL-treated calves were more likely to consume their entire daily milk allowance (P < 0.05) as compared with PLA-treated calves. Meloxicam-treated calves began consuming starter ration earlier (P < 0.01) and at a greater rate (P < 0.001), and consumed more water (P < 0.001) compared with PLA-treated animals. Over the study period, calves treated with MEL gained BW at a faster rate (P < 0.01) than calves treated with PLA. There was no difference in weaning weight (P > 0.05), but MEL-treated calves tended to wean earlier (P = 0.11) than PLA-treated calves. These results demonstrate that calves receiving a single injection of MEL at the onset of diarrhea had improved appetite and performance compared with PLA-treated calves. Thus, MEL is an effective supportive therapy for neonatal calf diarrhea complex.",

All calves were uniquely identified with Canadian Cattle Identification Agency tags at birth. Calves were fed colostrum until they left the farm of birth; each farm had its own specific colostrum management protocol. Briefly, 2 of the farms offered calves approximately 3 L of colostrum by nurse bottle at first discovery, after the colostrum of the dam had been harvested. The third farm fed calves 4 L of pooled colostrum by esophageal feeder within 6 h of birth. There was no evaluation of colostrum quality.",

Thus, the study was conducted in two 8-wk trials. At 1 to 3 d of age, the calves were transported from their farm of birth to the research site. On arrival, each calf was weighed using a calibrated livestock scale, and its umbilicus was disinfected with 7% tincture of iodine. In addition, 2 mL of Vitamin E-A-D Injectable (300, 100,000, and 10,000 IU/mL, respectively; Servi-Vet Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and 1 mL of Dystosel Injectable (3 mg/mL of selenium and 136 IU/mL of vitamin E; Pfizer Canada Animal Health Group, Kirkland, Quebec, Canada) were administered intramuscularly to each calf on the left side of the neck, using an 18-gauge, 2.5-cm needle. To determine the uniformity among calves for transfer of maternal immunoglobulins, a blood sample was collected by jugular venipuncture (10-mL Vacutainer without anticoagulant; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) on the day of calf arrival. After clotting at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged (1,500 \u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature), and serum was harvested and frozen for storage. At a later date, the serum was analyzed for serum total protein (TP) concentration by refractometry (Leica Vet360, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada).

The exact method was used to handle ties between calves that were weaned on the same day of age. Table 1 contains the predictor variables considered for inclusion in the multivariable models. Correlations between all predictor variables were examined to iden-tify highly collinear relationships. If any 2 predictor variables were identified as strongly collinear, the more biologically relevant predictor was chosen for inclusion in the model. The assumption of linearity between continuous predictor variables and each outcome was assessed by visual examination of smoothed scatter plots and the introduction of quadratic terms into the models. The full model was reduced using a manual backward elimination procedure. Predictor variables with P-values less than 0.05 were retained in the final model. Confounding was evaluated by removing individual predictor variables from the model and then determining the change in model coefficients. Any nonsignificant predictor variable causing greater than a 30% change in model coefficients on removal was considered a confounding variable and was included in the final model. Two-way interactions between MEL treatment and significant main effect predictor variables were evaluated by addition of product terms to the model. Statistically significant 2-way interaction terms (P < 0.05) were included in the final model. When significant interactions with treatment were identified, the data were stratified on the variable that was causing the effect modification and reanalyzed.",

The Wilcoxon test indicated that the survival functions for time to starter consumption for the MEL-and PLA-treated calves were different (\u03c7 2 = 8.55; P < 0.01). A Cox proportional hazards model for time to starter consumption, stratified by treatment and controlling for the effects of farm of origin, arrival BW, and age at treatment, was constructed.

Two PLA-treated calves died before fulfilling the starter consumption criteria and, accordingly, were censored from this analysis. The log cumulative hazard plot for time to starter consumption tended to support the assumption of proportional hazards because the curves were parallel along the sections that included the most observations. A mixed model for rate of starter ration consumption was constructed, and the model residuals indicated that starter intake was increasingly more variable over time. Thus, a heterogeneous first-order autoregressive correlation structure was applied to account for the temporal dependence in the starter ration intake measurements. An interaction between treatment and time was included in the final model. As such, starter ration consumption was stratified by week and least squares means were generated.

Serum TP is commonly used to assess passive transfer status in calves (Calloway et al., 2002) . A test value of less than 5.2 g/dL was applied to identify calves with failure of passive transfer (FPT), and it was determined that 77% of the calves had FPT.

Nevertheless, the increased FPT reported in this study is comparable with the immunocompetence status of calves in commercial veal facilities (Stull and McDonough, 1994) .

At the time this study was conducted, the incidence of neonatal calf diarrhea, and in particular, the occurrence of diarrhea associated with C. parvum, was increased throughout Ontario (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005 , 2008b . In 2002, the within-herd prevalence for C. parvum shedding by calves on 51 Ontario dairy farms was between 0 and 70% (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005) . In 2003, the withinherd prevalence for C. parvum shedding by calves on 11 Ontario dairy farms was between 35 and 100% (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007) . In the summer and fall of 2004, the within-herd prevalence for C. parvum shedding by calves on 119 Ontario dairy farms was between 0 and 80% (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008b) . Moreover, this research group found that the odds of diarrhea were 5.3 times greater among calves shedding C. parvum as compared with nonshedding calves (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007) . Thus, it is evident that C. parvum infection and diarrhea are common among preweaned dairy calves in Ontario, and can be a widespread problem on a given farm. The authors of this study had previously acquired calves from the 3 source farms used in this research. As such, at the onset of the study, the authors were familiar with the typical rates of neonatal diarrhea and C. parvum isolation in calves from these farms and had expected the incidence of diarrhea to be increased. Fecal samples were collected from the calves, and it was determined that C. parvum was the primary agent of infection, but rotavirus and coronavirus were also isolated from the feces of some of the calves (Todd, 2007) . Thus, the increased incidence of naturally occur- ring diarrhea among the calves may have been due to C. parvum being spread between calves and throughout the study environment.",

Hart (1988) examined the biological basis of sickness behavior and argued that anorexia and adipsia are part of a highly evolved strategy to combat infection. Briefly, in response to peripheral infection, mononuclear phagocytic cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), which carry signals to the central nervous system (CNS) to induce the sickness response (Dantzer, 2001) . In modern livestock production systems, subtle changes in appetite and thirst are often used as behavioral cues to help identify sick animals and opportunities for intervention (Sowell et al., 1999; Thomson and White, 2006; Huzzey et al., 2007; Weary et al., 2009) . However, when sick animals routinely receive supportive care and veterinary treatment, the effects of sickness behavior responses, such as anorexia and adipsia, on convalescence needs to be taken into consideration (Millman, 2007) .",

The differences in milk intake between MEL-and PLA-treated calves may have been due to the anti-inflammatory activity of MEL. Enteric infection would likely have stimulated the release of proinflammatory cytokines into the periphery, which would have communicated with the CNS to induce anorexia and sickness behavior (Johnson, 1998) . However, administering MEL to calves at the onset of diarrhea may partially block the proinflammatory cytokine pathways and, accordingly, inhibit the inflammatory response. Central and peripheral proinflammatory cytokine concentrations were not measured in this study; therefore, it cannot be confirmed that these mechanisms were involved in, or responsible for, the differences in milk consumption between MEL-and PLA-treated calves. Despite these questions about the proximate mechanisms behind this behavioral response, the results clearly demonstrate that during an episode of neonatal calf diarrhea complex, MEL therapy was important in enabling a strong appetite for milk.",

This effect could have been due to differences in appetite development. However, Appleby et al.

Thus, even though in the present study the calves were fed a restricted milk diet, it is likely that after the first few days of life, the calves had adapted to the whole milk diet and the mechanisms for sucking were developed. An alternative explanation is that the differences in milk consumption between the younger and older calves were a consequence of the causal agents of diarrhea. In this study, a larger percentage of calves that enrolled after 10 d of age had C. parvum isolated in their feces, whereas a greater number of younger calves had diarrhea associated with rotavirus or coronavirus (Todd, 2007) . The pathophysiology of cryptosporidiosis and viral diarrhea is different (Foster and Smith, 2009) , which could offer some insight into the calf age effects on milk consumption.",

Thus, one can hypothesize that MEL administration mitigated the sickness behavior response, which in turn resulted in improved appetite for the calf starter ration and increased thirst. The differences in water intake, however, coincide with periods in which MEL-treated calves were consuming significantly larger quantities of starter ration than PLA-treated animals. Given that water and calf starter intake are strongly correlated (Kertz et al., 1984) , the increased consumption of starter ration may have stimulated the calves to consume more water.",

However, several other studies have identified positive associations between NSAID therapy and appetite in sick animals. Baile et al.

            "text": "Overall, MEL-treated calves experienced greater BW gain after diarrhea compared with PLA-treated calves. This increased growth can likely be attributed to differences in metabolism and nutrient intake. During disease states, proinflammatory cytokines target the CNS and other organ systems, including skeletal muscle, the liver, and adipose tissue, to cause a shift in the balance between anabolic to catabolic processes (Johnson, 1997) . Proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS inhibit the production of GHRH and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby leading to reductions in plasma concentrations of GH and IGF-I (Sartin et al., 1998) . In skeletal muscle, proinflammatory cytokines cause increased muscle protein catabolism and reduced AA uptake (Johnson, 1997) . Many of the AA from muscle proteolysis are diverted to the liver to support acute phase protein production. Positive acute phase proteins are markers of inflammation and are synthesized in large numbers in response to immune activation (Horadagoda et al., 1999) . The release of proinflammatory cytokines also affects fat metabolism in adipose tissue, causing increased lipolysis and reduced lipoprotein lipase activity (Johnson, 1997) . These metabolic responses, together with changes in milk consumption, may have contributed to the slight depression in BW gain by MEL-and PLA-treated calves during wk 2 after diarrhea. However, this reduction in growth was more marked for PLAtreated calves. Therefore, MEL therapy may have acted by mitigating some of the sickness-induced changes in metabolism. During the later stages of the study period, MEL-treated calves tended to experience larger BW gain than PLA-treated animals. These differences in growth were probably an effect of improved consumption of milk and calf starter ration by MEL-treated calves. In feedlot cattle with bovine respiratory disease, long-term improvements in BW gain after treatment with MEL and antimicrobial therapy, compared with a positive control, have also been reported (Friton et al., 2005) .",

The greater nutrient intake by MEL-treated calves also supported increased BW gains and a reduction in the time to weaning. Therefore, MEL appears to be an effective supportive therapy for calves with neonatal calf diarrhea complex in terms of calf performance, appetite, and animal welfare.",
