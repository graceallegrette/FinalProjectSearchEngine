We employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. We found significant positive correlation (p=0.03) between European Mesolithic hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio and a marginally significant negative correlation (p=0.06) between Neolithic Iranian ancestry fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio. We further identified 404 immune response related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries in a genome wide association study (GWAS). Prominently we identified that SNPs associated with Interferon stimulated antiviral response, Interferon-stimulated gene 15 mediated antiviral mechanism and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase mediated antiviral response show large differences in allele frequencies between Europeans and East Asians. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation. While our current findings improve our overall understanding of the COVID-19, we note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from a more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.",

Recently, Cao et al. analysed 1700 variants in ACE2 from ChinaMAP and 1000 Genomes Project databases 5 . While they reported the absence of natural resistant mutations for coronavirus S-protein binding across their study populations, their study revealed significant variation in allele frequencies (AF) among the populations assessed, including between people of East Asian and European ancestries. They speculated that the differences in AFs of ACE2 coding variants, likely associated with its elevated expression may influence ACE2 function and putatively impact SARS infectivity among the evaluated populations. Additionally, a majority of the 15 eQTL variants they identified had discernibly higher AFs among East Asian populations compared to Europeans, which may suggest differential susceptibility towards coronavirus in these two populations under similar conditions.",

Interestingly, the other Iberian country, Portugal, despite reporting fewer numbers of COVID-19 cases compared to neighboring Spain, has a significantly high death to recovery ratio (3.93) underscoring the likely association between high WHG ancestry proportions in Iberians and the severity of COVID-19 infection. The WHG ancestry proportion is discernibly high among the Basque people in Spain (33.9%) and congruent with our hypothesis, the death percentage in Basque country is significantly higher compared to other Spanish provinces (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102882/cases-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-spain-in-2020-by-region/) .

Additionally, they reported that most eQTL variants identified by them had discernibly higher AFs among East Asian populations compared to Europeans, which may result in differential susceptibility towards the novel coronavirus in these two populations under similar conditions.

Most East Asians derive their ancestry from Mongolian huntergatherers who dispersed over Northeast Asia 6000-8000 years ago 22 . Similarly, Southeast Asians exhibit a mixture of East Asian ancestry (Southern Chinese agriculturalist) and a diverged form of Eastern Eurasian hunter-gatherer ancestry (EHGs) 23 . People with similar ancestry can be found as far south as Indonesia 23 . As noted above EHG ancestry fraction does not appear to be significantly associated with COVID-19 manifestation. In congruence with their unique ancestral make-up, all East and Southeast Asian countries exhibit low COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (Japan=0.15, South Korea=0.03, Hong Kong=0.02, Taiwan=0.1, Thailand=0.03, Malaysia=0.06 and Singapore=0.02). Notably, in mainland China, where the novel coronavirus originated and the catastrophe first initiated, COVID-19 death to recovery ratio has remained discernibly low (0.04). Overall, our results indicate that people of East and Southeast Asian ancestry appear to be intrinsically protected against the most debilitating effects of the novel coronavirus infection. South Asians: a variegated canvas for COVID-19 South Asians have a long and complex history of admixture between immigrant gene-pools originating primarily in West Eurasia, Southeast Asia and the South Asian hunter-gatherer lineage with close genetic proximity to the present-day Andamanese people (Ancient Ancestral South Indians: AASI) who likely arrived in India through the \"southern exit\" wave out of Africa 24 . People of AASI ancestry admixed with an undivided ancient Iranian lineage that subsequently split and lead to the formation of early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter gatherers approximately in the 3 rd millennium BCE. This gene pool is referred to as the 'Indus Periphery' gene pool 24,25 , which is thought to be the major source of subsequent peopling of South Asia. Modern-day South Asian genome is composed of largely four ancestral components: Ancestral North Indian (ANI), Ancestral South Indian (ASI), Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB), and Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA) 26 . ANI and ASI gene pools likely arose around 2 nd millennium BCE during the decline of Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), which prompted multiple waves of migrations across the South Asia. The southward migration of Middle to Late Bronze Age people from Steppe (Steppe MLBA) into South Asia to have coincided with the decline of IVC. It is speculated that the people of Indus-Periphery-related ancestry, while migrating northward, admixed with Steppe MLBA immigrants to form the ANI, while the others, who migrated southward and eastward admixed with AASI and formed the ASI 25 . Austroasiatic speakers originated in Southeast Asia and subsequently migrated to South Asia during the Neolithic period. The admixture between local South Asians and incoming Southeast Asians took place ~2000-3800 years ago giving rise to the AAA ancestry. Notably, the South Asian population(s) with whom the incoming Southeast Asians mingled were AASI related with little to no West Eurasian ancestry fraction 27 . Finally, it has been showed that the Tibeto-Burmans (ATBs) derived their ancestry through admixture with low-altitude East Asians who migrated from China and likely across Northern India or Myanmar 28 leading to the high genomic proximity between South Asians of ATB ancestry and East Asians. The genomic proximity between East Asians and South Asians mostly from Northeast India with prominent ATB ancestry, is likely reflected through fewer numbers of COVID-19 cases from this region, so far (one case each in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, and two in Manipur). Notably the death to recovery ratio in the largely ATB dominated region of Ladakh, India is zero, indicating complete recovery so far of COVID-19 infected individuals from this region, while the same in its neighboring state of Jammu and Kashmir with predominant ANI ancestral fractions is discernibly higher (0.5). Further, Indian states with large number of indigenous tribal population with prevalence of AAA ancestry and/or with large fractions of AASI-related ancestry, eg. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa have not registered any COVID related deaths till date, indicating that South Asians with dominant AAA and AASI related ancestry may also likely be less severely affected against the most detrimental effects of COVID-19 infection.",

Our interrogation of worldwide populations suggests that the WHG ancestral fraction is likely associated with acute COVID-19 manifestation and is predictive of debilitating effects of COVID-19 infection among South Asian populations with substantial fractions of WHG ancestry. Overall COVID-19 manifestation in South Asia is likely to be somewhat intermediate to that observed in Europe and East Asia. This is underscored by the recent finding that AFs of ACE2 variants among South Asians are intermediate between East Asians and Europeans 5 ..
