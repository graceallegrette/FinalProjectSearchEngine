A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change as first governmental intervention measures are showing an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. For the case of COVID-19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate which correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate analogue change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.",

The uncertainty on the short term arises because the magnitude of our social distancing in the past two weeks could not be quantified yet. Beyond two weeks, the case numbers depend on our future behavior, for which we have to make explicit assumptions.

Thereby, the efficiency of political and individual measures for social distancing and containment can be assessed in a timely manner. We find first evidence for a successive decrease of the spreading rate in Germany around March 8 and around March 16, which significantly reduced the magnitude of exponential growth, but was not sufficient to turn growth into decay. The development in the coming two weeks will reveal the efficiency of the subsequent social distancing measures. In general, our analysis code may help to infer the efficiency of measures taken in other countries and inform policy makers about tightening, loosening and selecting appropriate rules for containment. Inference of spreading rate \u03bb from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany, and forecast of future evolution. A: Prior (blue) and posterior (orange) distributions for four of the central parameters of a SIR model with two change points (at time t1 and t2), where the spreading rate changes from \u03bb0 \u2192 \u03bb1 \u2192 \u03bb2. B: The inferred effective growth rate \u03bb * , i.e. the difference between spreading and recovery rate (\u03bb * = \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5) for an SIR model which assumes one, two or three change points (red, orange, green). The models with two or three change points are favored over the one with one change point by formal Bayesian model comparison. The inferred change points correspond well to the timing of the governmental interventions in Germany (depicted as * ). C,D: The model fit of the new confirmed cases and (cumulative) total confirmed cases is depicted for the models with one, two or three change points. The three future scenarios depend strongly on whether one includes the second or third change point: the number of new confirmed cases will grow exponentially, be approximately constant, or decay exponentially (red, orange, green). Hence, the future development depends predominantly on our behavior. B,C: Note the delay D between change point (i.e. change in spreading behavior) and observation of confirmed cases of almost two weeks.",

            "text": "During the initial outbreak of an epidemic, reliable short-term forecasts are key to estimate required medical capacities, and to inform and advice the public and the decision makers [1] . During this initial phase, three tasks are of particular importance to provide time-critical information for crisis mitigation: (1) establishing central epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number that can be used for short-term forecasting; (2) simulating the effects of different possible intervention measures aimed at mitigation of the outbreak; (3) estimating the actual effects of the measures taken to rapidly adjust them and to adapt short-term forecasts. Tackling these tasks is challenging due to the large statistical and systematic errors present during the initial stages of an epidemic with its low case numbers. Further complications arise from mitigation measures being taken rapidly, while the outbreak unfolds, but taking effect only after an unknown delay. To obtain sensible parameter estimates for short-term forecasting and policy evaluation despite these complications, any prior knowledge available needs to be integrated into modeling efforts to reduce uncertainties. This includes knowledge about basic mechanisms of disease transmission, recovery, as well as preliminary estimates of epidemiological parameters from other countries, or from closely related pathogens. The integration of prior knowledge, the quantitative assessment of the remaining uncertainties about epidemiological parameters, and the principled propagation of these uncertainties into forecasts is the domain of Bayesian modeling and inference.",

This simple model can be formulated in terms of coupled ordinary differential equations (in mean field), which enable analytical treatment [6, 7] or fast evaluation ideally suited for Bayesian inference. Accordingly, SIR-like models have been used to model epidemic spreads, from detailed scenario discussions [8] [9] [10] to Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation [11] [12] [13] . Recently, this family of models also played a dominant role in the analyses of the global COVID-19 outbreak, from scenario forecast [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] to inference [20] [21] [22] .",

This matches the timing of the first two governmental mitigation measures, i.e. first the cancellation of large public events such as trade fairs and soccer matches, and second the closing of schools, child-care facilities, and non-essential shops. We expect a further change point because a third, more stringent lock-down measure was introduced in the following week (March 22nd). However, at present case data do not provide the necessary information on the strength of that third change in \u03bb due to the delay D between infection and report of the confirmed case of about 10 days. In a situation like this where we know that a change in the spreading rate \u03bb has happened but its effect is unobservable yet, forecasts are necessarily difficult.",

BACKGROUND Initial phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in Germany is well captured by a standard SIR model An epidemic outbreak in the absence of mitigation measures can be described by an SIR model with a constant spreading rate \u03bb. Effects of mitigation measures can be approximated as change points in \u03bb, which only manifest after starting mitigation measures and an observation delay. Since first serious interventions in Germany occurred around March 8th, we thus restrict our first estimation to the time period 2020/03/01-2020/03/15.",

We obtain as median estimates for the spreading rate \u03bb = 0.41, \u00b5 = 0.12, D = 8.7, and I 0 = 18. Converted to the basic reproduction number R 0 , a central epidemiological parameter, we find a median R 0 = \u03bb/\u00b5 = 3.3 (CI [2.4, 4.7] ), which is consistent with previous reports that find values between 2.3 and 3.3 [21, 24, 25] . Overall, the model shows good agreement for both new infections C t (Fig. 1 A) and the cumulative infections t t =0 C t (Fig. 1 B) with the expected exponential growth (linear in lin-log plot). The absolute deviation between data and model ( Fig. 1 C) is well captured by the case-number-dependent width of our likelihood (Methods) motivated by demographic noise in mean-field models of spreading processes [26, 27] . However, we observe that for some model parameters, the distribution of estimated parameters (the posterior distribution, Fig. 1 D-H histogram) is largely determined by our initial choice of assumed parameters (the prior distribution, Fig. 1 D-H blue line). In particular, while \u03bb and I 0 are sufficiently constrained by the data, \u00b5 an D are not. This is to be expected for the initial phase of an epidemic outbreak, which is dominated by exponential growth.",

This is further supported by a systematic scan of the model's log-likelihood in the \u03bb-\u00b5 space showing an equipotential line for the maximum likelihood ( Fig. 1 J) . This verifies that the effective growth rate \u03bb * is the relevant free parameter with median \u03bb * = 28% from the complete MCMC sampling ( Fig. 1 I) . The control parameter of the dynamics in the exponential onset phase is thus the effective growth rate \u03bb * = \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5 ( Fig. 1 I) : If the spreading rate is larger than the recovery rate, \u03bb > \u00b5, case numbers grow exponentially.

However, the COVID-19 spread in Germany has by mid-March led to a considerable change in policy and in the behavior of individuals, starting from washing hands more thoroughly and stricter self-isolation upon suspicious symptoms to formal measures like closing public events and places, schools and even introducing a contact ban. The aim of all these measures was to reduce the effective spreading rate \u03bb * = \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5. As soon as the recovery rate \u00b5 is larger than (absolute) spreading rate \u03bb, the number of new confirmed infections should diminish (after the respective delay). As the recovery rate is hard to influence (clinical intervention, immunization), it is expected that these measures dominantly lead to changes in the spreading rate. Hence, detecting change points in the spreading rate -and quantifying the amount of change as quickly as possible -becomes a central modelling challenge, especially with respect to short-term forecasts.

Note that the tell-tale kink in the data is more evident in the raw number of newly confirmed cases (Fig. 3 A) than in the cumulative report (Fig. 3 B) . The inferred temporal decrease of new cases, before increasing again, comes from changing an exponential growth rate over small time-interval in the model.

Nonetheless, the observed case numbers already suggest that the second change point brought the disease spread close to the critical transition that separates exponential growth from a decline of new cases.

Thus, it seems important to assess whether the posterior median value of D = 9.5 days is at least compatible with what is known. In our model D sums up at least three separate factors, i.e. the biological incubation period, and an additional delay from first very mild symptoms to symptoms warranting testing under the constraint of limiting testing capacities, and a possible delay before a testing slot is available. At present, the incubation is reported by the WHO as being in a broad range from 1-14 days with a mean of 5 days [29] , and the WHO states that 'symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually'. A gradual onset of symptoms may delay testing because people tend to wait before asking to be tested, or may be asked to wait as testing in more urgent cases is prioritized. Adding a mean of 5 days of incubation period to the patient waiting for three days after gradual symptom onset before asking for a test, and waiting 1 days for a test would be a plausible scenario in Germany. The resulting 9 days are compatible with the median and spread of the posterior median of D = 9.5 we found, given the wide range of durations for the incubation period. It should be noted in addition, that once mass-testing for asymptomatic members of the general population is available, or even mandatory, a change point for D will certainly have to be added to the model.",
