As the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and Europe, COPD results in a substantial and ever increasing economic and social burden [1] . Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are frequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although there is no standardized definition, AECOPD are characterized by a significant change in patient symptoms from baseline accompanied by overall increased airway resistance [2] . These exacerbations carry a significant risk to patients, with 10 % in-hospital mortality and 1-year and 2-year all-cause mortality rates of 43 % and 49 %, respectively, in patients with hypercapnic exacerbations [3] . Other studies note in-hospital mortality rates as high as 30 % with worse outcomes associated with older age, severity of respiratory and non-respiratory organ dysfunction, and hospital length of stay [4] . Given that patients transferred to the ICU with AECOPD are at high risk for complications and adverse outcomes, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and survival in this population.",

These conditions may coexist with or precipitate AECOPD. Thus, it is important to pursue a thorough diagnostic workup in tandem with ongoing therapeutic interventions. Additional diagnostic measures including chest computerized tomography (CT), echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, brain naturetic peptide (BNP), and respiratory viral molecular testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

A trial by Niewoehner [9] Note: Indications will vary by institution and ability to do noninvasive ventilation outside of the ICU and colleagues demonstrated that there was no benefit of 8 weeks of steroid treatment compared to 2 weeks [12] . Although some studies in patients with AECOPD suggest that a 5-day regimen of 40 mg of prednisone may be superior to 14 days, no trials have clearly defined the optimal regimen for patients with severe exacerbations requiring ICU admission [13] . In general, we recommend intravenous steroid administration with 0.5-1.0 mg/kg methylprednisolone every 6 h for 24 h with tapering to twice daily and then daily over the course of 2-3 days as tolerated for patients with severe exacerbations admitted to the ICU. In general, the duration of treatment should not exceed 14 days. Oral steroids are likely equivalent to intravenous formulations if the patient can take pills by mouth. Careful monitoring for side effects including alterations in cognition, hyperglycemia, insomnia, fluid retention, and peptic ulcer formation is essential; routine H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor prescription should accompany steroid therapy in those admitted to the ICU [14] .",

Metered-dose inhalers should be used for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. As there is no evidence to support the addition of methylxanthines during an exacerbation, routine use is not recommended [8, 15] .",

Antibiotic use during COPD exacerbations reduces treatment failures, need for mechanical ventilation, risk for readmission, as well as mortality when administered in the inpatient setting [16] [17] [18] . A study by Anthonisen et al. showed that patients with increases in sputum production or changes in sputum color experienced a greater benefit from antibiotics [19] . In addition, a study of patients with AECOPD requiring mechanical ventilation showed that administration of a fluoroquinolone reduced mortality and the need for additional antibiotics when compared to placebo [20] . Therefore, antibiotics are recommended for patients admitted to the ICU, particularly those requiring mechanical ventilation [1, 8] . In uncomplicated patients, a beta-lactam, macrolide, or tetracycline antibiotic may be used [8] . For most ICU patients, we recommend a respiratory fluoroquinolone, third-or fourth-generation cephalosporin, or piperacillin/tazobactam. Coverage for atypical bacteria with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone is also recommended if the patient lives in the community. Broader coverage for nosocomial pathogens is recommended for patients residing in health-care settings and those who have had recent or repetitive contact with the hospital environment or therapeutic courses of antimicrobial agents. Combination therapy is often necessary [1, 14, 15] . See Table 13 .3 for antibiotic recommendations. In general, a total duration of 7 days of antibiotics is usually appropriate. Coverage may be tailored based on sputum culture results and sensitivities.",

In patients with COPD, increased airway resistance may result in incomplete deflation of the lungs prior to initiation of the next breath, causing the intra-alveolar volume and therefore pressure to remain elevated above that which is desired. This dynamic hyperinflation creates auto-PEEP (in contrast to the intentional application of extrinsic PEEP via mechanical ventilation). The presence of auto-PEEP is important as it can increase the work of breathing, trigger patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, and worsen gas exchange. Auto-PEEP may result in misinterpretation of clinical data such as central venous or pulmonary arterial catheter measurements and lead to unnecessary treatments such as higher doses of sedative medications [25] .",

Misdiagnosis of the etiology of shock in this setting may lead to unnecessary fluid and vasopressor administration; failure to recognize and correct auto-PEEP may result in hemodynamic collapse and death. For this reason, any mechanically ventilated patient with COPD and new onset hypotension should be assessed for the presence Minute ventilation requirements will vary by patient, and settings for tidal volume and respiratory rate will need to be considered on an individual basis. High respiratory rates may provoke a shortened expiratory phase and lead to air trapping, auto-PEEP, and hemodynamic compromise of auto-PEEP. If hemodynamic compromise from auto-PEEP is present, disconnection from the ventilator circuit for 10-20 seconds should facilitate a release of air from the patient's pulmonary tree and improve hemodynamics. Auto-PEEP can be monitored on the ventilator through the use of the end-expiratory hold maneuver (although accurate measurements require that the patient have no active respiratory effort) [25] . Auto-PEEP may also be identified by monitoring the flow-time trace where the exhilatory trace fails to return to baseline prior to the start of the next breath. Significant auto-PEEP may be treated by careful ventilator management aimed at increasing the expiratory time to allow adequate emptying of the lungs. Maneuvers include increasing the inspiratory flow rate and decreasing the respiratory rate or tidal volume. Other methods for minimizing auto-PEEP include reduction of spontaneous ventilatory demand through the administration of sedation, analgesia, and occasionally paralytics. Similarly, reducing flow resistance with larger bore endotracheal tubes, frequent suctioning, and bronchodilator administration may also reduce auto-PEEP by reducing resistance to gas flow. Expiratory flow limitation can also be counterbalanced with the application of applied (external) PEEP to match the intrinsic (auto) PEEP [25] .",

Oral agents including PDE-5 inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) are typically not appropriate for use in the acute ICU setting (except in selected treatmentna\u00efve PAH patients who have been stabilized with IV prostanoids) and thus will not be covered in this chapter.",

Therefore, abrogation of acidosis may be a useful therapeutic goal using either augmented minute ventilation or intravenous fluids that influence pH such as those constructed entirely of, or supplemented with, sodium bicarbonate or sodium acetate (especially when NaHCO 3 is in short supply).",

There is debate as to the first-line agent for inotropic support, but in general, dobutamine is preferred over dopamine for acute inotropic support in unstable patients in the ICU, especially since dopamine is strongly pro-arrhythmogenic at higher doses. Milrinone is also often strongly considered, particularly in patients with biventricular failure.

As with inotropic support, careful selection of the most appropriate vasopressor will vary depending on the clinical scenario.

The presence of atrial arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia) and electrical conduction delays (e.g., complete heart block) is associated with worse outcomes given that the RV is highly dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate filling. Rate control alone is not typically sufficient and rhythm control is recommended. Electrical cardioversion for tachyarrhythmias and atrioventricular (AV) pacing for bradyarrhythmias are the first-line treatments for unstable patients. Amiodarone is the recommended first-line medication for most tachyarrhythmias due to its lower risk of hypotension and comparatively fewer negative inotropic effects. The use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers is generally avoided given that both classes of agents may impair RV contractility as well as AV nodal conduction [32, 33] .",

The risk for systemic hypotension and hemodynamic collapse during intubation as a result of sedative administration is significant.

Therefore, noninvasive ventilation should be considered prior to intubation if the patient's clinical condition is stable enough for a trial. However, if intubation is necessary, etomidate is the preferred drug for induction of general anesthesia given its minimal effect of cardiac contractility and vascular tone. One should recognize that controversy exists regarding the effects of etomidate on later adrenal function, and alternative agents should be considered dictated by provider training and agent availability. Preemptive administration of vasopressors and or inotropes prior to intubation to offset the commonly induced hypotension should also be considered [32, 35] .",
