One such difference pertains to the mechanisms and enzymes responsible for generation of the proposed viral 5 RNA cap. Within the Coronaviridae family, two separate methytransferases (MTase), nsp14 and nsp16, perform the RNA-cap N7-guanine and 2 -OH methylation respectively for generation of the proposed m7GpppNm type I cap structure. For the majority of other families within the Nidovirales order, the presence, structure and key enzymes involved in 5 capping are far less clear. These viruses either lack completely an RNA MTase signature sequence, or lack an N7-guanine methyltransferase signature sequence, obscuring our understanding about how RNA-caps are N7-methylated for these families. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossmann fold RNA methyltransferase in 10 Tobaniviridae members in Orf1a, an unusual genome locus for this gene. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses lead us to propose this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7guanine MTase.",

It is currently presumed that most Nidovirales genomes carry a 5 cap structure which serves to both protect the viral genome from host degradation by 5 exonucleases and to signal translation of the genome. The evidence for the presence of an RNA cap comes from immunological detection in Torovirus (family Tobaniviridae) genomic and sg mRNAs (6) and co-migration analysis using low-resolution chromatographic techniques for Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, family CoV) (7) and Simian Hemorragic fever virus (family Arteriviridae) (8), however there is still no high-resolution structural analysis available for any Nidovirales RNA cap. Other families of the Nidovirales order are assumed to contain a canonical 5 cap based on the presence of enzymes required in the capping pathway (reviewed in (9)), although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these viruses.",

Most +RNA viruses supposedly follow this conventional RNA capping pathway in which nascent viral 5 -triphosphate genomic RNA (and sg mR-NAs) is processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway involves firstly the hydrolysis of the 5 -triphosphate RNA into a 5 -diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase. A GMP residue (the cap , originating from GTP) is subsequently covalently transferred to the 5 -diphosphate RNA in the 5 to 5 orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2 -oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) respectively, by one or two S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM)dependent RNA methyltransferases (MTases) (9) .",

Briefly, RF-MTases are characterized predominantly by two structural features; first, a \u2424\u2423\u2424 architecture (formed by a seven-stranded \u2424sheet surrounded by 6 \u2423-helices, with the seventh \u2424-strand inserted in an anti-parallel orientation between the fifth and sixth strand) and secondly a glycine rich loop (G-x-G-x n -G) which interacts with the SAM cofactor. Viral 2 -O MTases can be further distinguished by the presence of a conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad, and in general have been much better defined than N7-guanine MTases at the structural and functional level (reviewed in (9)). While various crystal structures of viral enzymes involved in N7-guanine methyltransferase activity have been resolved (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , the identification of a specific signature sequences is far less clear.",

Importantly, we also report the discovery of an RF-MTase sequence in the Orf1a of ten members of the Tobaniviridae family, an unusual and previously unseen location for this enzyme. Remarkably, sequence base structure alignments reveal that this enzyme is closely related to the canonical eukaryotic RF-N7-guanine MTase, suggesting it performs the currently missing N7-guanine RNA cap methylation for this family. If this is the case, this would represent the first RF-N7-guanine MTase identified for the Nidovirales order.

It has been previously reported that the N7-guanine MTase domain is not uniformly present in nsp14-containing nidoviruses (24). Only the Tobaniviridae is expanded and genera indicated in italic plus unassigned viruses (see Figure 1 ). We therefore deduce that the nidovirus enzyme responsible for N7-guanine methylation does not appear to be located in a conserved genomic location, nor contains a conserved structural architecture. The majority of viruses in the CoV and Mesoniviridae families appear to utilise a nidoviruses specific, NRF-MTase located directly downstream of the ExoN domain, as described for SARS-CoV.

One possibility would be that the RF-MTase identified at the 3 end of Orf1b is bi-functional, carrying both 2 -O and N7-guanine methylation activity, as seen for the Flavivirus NS5 MTase. However, there is no obvious signature sequence to indicate bi-functionality, and furthermore no evidence to suggest that the activity for those virus families would deviate from the 2 -O methylation specificity shown for the same domain of largegenome nidoviruses (36, 37) . Another possibility would be that another gene would code for an enzyme performing this methylation, and had escaped detection by standard bioinformatic methods. We thus performed a more extensive search for MTase signature-sequences along the whole Orf1ab in all Nidovirales. Surprisingly, a RF-MTase signature-sequence was detected in Orf1a of 10 members of the Tobaniviridae family ( Figure 2 ). Strictly conserved amino-acids in these new viral MTases define three motifs (i) three glycines of the SAM binding site (Gly54, Gly56 and Gly58 in white bream virus (WBV)) located just downstream of a three amino acids hydrophobic segment in a \u2424-strand motif, (ii) a histidine (His117 in WBV) immediately followed by either a phenylalanine or tyrosine and (iii) a glutamic acid (Glu175 in WBV) (Figure 3 ).

A wealth of structural and mechanistic data has been acquired from N7-guanine MTases from the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Ecm1, PDB ID: 1Z3C) (38) (39) . Combining this data with structural information from the human RNA N7-guanine methyltransferase (PDB ID: 3BGV), we were unable to define specific N7-guanine MTase sequence motifs ( Supplementary Figure S1 ), suggesting that structural conservation has likely prevailed over sequence conservation. We therefore narrowed the structural comparison to include only Encephalitozoon cuniculi, poxvirus and the human RNA N7-guanine Mtases. This allowed detection of five conserved amino acid motifs K/G/D/HY/E/Y (Supplementary Figure S2) , spatially coherent in the structure to fulfil the binding and catalytic reaction.",

Most of these viral MTases, with SARS-CoV nsp14 as a notable exception, belong to the RF family of enzymes (reviewed in (9) ). The RF is an evolutionary ancient fold, which has been widely evolved to perform a variety of chemical reactions. Its structural plasticity is well illustrated by the Blue tongue virus VP4 MTase (family Reoviridae) which incorporates an entire functional domain within two additional secondary structure elements, in addition to the flavivirus NS5 MTase, which is able to perform both N7-guanine and 2 -O ribose methylation with the same \u223c33 kDa domain fused to the N-terminus of the viral RdRp (23, 39) .",

Conversely, N7-guanine methylation does not appear to obey any particular rule, neither at the structural nor at the biochemical level. Furthermore, the pathway and target molecule for N7-guanine methylation appears to be somewhat variable. For example in some families of viruses this reaction can be performed on a GTP molecule which is then used to cap the RNA (40) . This is the case with the alphavirus nsp1 enzyme, whose structure is currently unknown. On the other hand, several crystal structures of viral enzymes involved in N7-guanine methylation of RNA caps have been reported, such as that of flaviviruses (NS5, (23, 39) ), rotaviruses and reoviruses (VP4 and lambda2, respectively (21, 22) ), and coronaviruses (nsp14, (19, 20) ). As stated above, the majority of these N7-MTases also adopt a RF (with the exception of SARS nsp14).

Protein and enzyme functions in Nidovirales have been classified into a functional triangle (24) , with each side of the triangle representing a carrier of the following roles: Orf1a-host defense; Orf1b--genome replication and maintenance; 3 nested Orfs--structural and accessory proteins. In this triangle, the MTase activity involved in genome maintenance would usually map to Orf1b (24) . The location in Orf1a may therefore suggest additional or auxiliary roles in tasks other than RNA capping, however this remains to be determined. Accordingly, it was recently reported that viral or cellular MTases can be recruited by viruses in order to induce internal methylation of their genome (41) and escape to the antiviral response mediated by MDA5 (42) . Furthermore, \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting being a mechanism commonly used in viral and cellular proteins to regulate ratios and copy numbers of specific genes, it would suggest that the levels of Orf1a products is higher than those of Orf1b, raising the question as to why only Tobaniviridae members would need this additional MTase in higher quantities.",

The identification of novel, putative RF-MTase domains may unveil the currently missing enzyme behind N7-guanine methylation for several viral families. If this is the case, it is a surprising structural deviation from the known CoV NRF-N7-guanine MTase nsp14. Dual N7 and 2 -O methylation activity by RF-MTases is also possible, as evidenced by the flavivirus NS5 MTase, particularly for families for which only a single (nsp16-like) MTase could be identified.",

Their presence and properties in a phylogenetic tree may well give interesting clues regarding RNA genome evolution and its associated issue of host defense mechanisms.",

Both light red and yellow MTases map to the nsp14 C-ter locus, ie. immediately downstrean the ExoN domain, while nsp16-like MTase map to the nsp16 locus, at the end of Orf1b. The tree was made based on MAFFT v7.427 multiple sequence alignment with BLOSUM62 scoring matrix and G-INS-i iterative refinement method. The alignments were used as input for maximum likelihood trees generated with the FasTtree v2.1.5 software (best-fit model = JTT-Jones-Taylor-Thorton with single rate of evolution for each site = CAT). Local support values were computed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH) with 1000 replicates. Numbers at the nodes represent FasTtree support values and scale var substitutions per site.
