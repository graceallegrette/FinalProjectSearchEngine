            "text": "The 39-terminal domain of the most conserved ORF1b in three of the four families of the order Nidovirales (except for the family Arteriviridae) encodes a (putative) 29-O-methyltransferase (29-O-MTase), known as non structural protein (nsp) 16 in the family Coronaviridae and implicated in methylation of the 59 cap structure of nidoviral mRNAs. As with coronavirus transcripts, arterivirus mRNAs are assumed to possess a 59 cap although no candidate MTases have been identified thus far. To address this knowledge gap, we analysed the uncharacterized nsp12 of arteriviruses, which occupies the ORF1b position equivalent to that of the nidovirus 29-O-MTase (coronavirus nsp16). In our in-depth bioinformatics analysis of nsp12, the protein was confirmed to be family specific whilst having diverged much further than other nidovirus ORF1b-encoded proteins, including those of the family Coronaviridae. Only one invariant and several partially conserved, predominantly aromatic residues were identified in nsp12, which may adopt a structure with alternating a-helices and b-strands, an organization also found in known MTases. However, no statistically significant similarity was found between nsp12 and the twofold larger coronavirus nsp16, nor could we detect MTase activity in biochemical assays using recombinant equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp12. Our further analysis established that this subunit is essential for replication of this prototypic arterivirus. Using reverse genetics, we assessed the impact of 25 substitutions at 14 positions, yielding virus phenotypes ranging from WT-like to non-viable. Notably, replacement of the invariant phenylalanine 109 with tyrosine was lethal. We concluded that nsp12 plays an essential role during EAV replication, possibly by acting as a co-factor for another enzyme.",

            "text": "Members of the family Arteriviridae are positive-stranded RNA viruses with genome sizes ranging from 13 to 16 kb. The family currently comprises a single genus (Arterivirus) that includes four species: Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Faaberg et al., 2012; Snijder et al., 2013) . Amongst those, the latter is the economically most relevant species causing annual losses to the American swine industry alone of *$800 million (Sang et al., 2014) . Additionally, several recently identified arteriviruses remain to be formally classified, but are likely to prototype multiple novel species or even higher-order taxa (Bailey et al., 2014; Dunowska et al., 2012; Lauck et al., 2011 Lauck et al., , 2013 . Arterivirus genomes are polycistronic and contain 10-15 (known) ORFs. The 59-proximal ORFs 1a and 1b are expressed as polyproteins (pps) 1a and 1ab that are autoproteolytically processed into the non structural proteins (nsps) required for genome replication and transcription ( Fig. 1) (Molenkamp et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "ORF1b is the most conserved part of the nidovirus genome and all ORF1b-encoded proteins characterized thus far are enzymes conserved in two or more nidovirus families. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) fused with a superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) are conserved in all nidoviruses. In contrast, six other domains are lineage specific. Four of these are conserved in two or three nidovirus families only: exoribonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), nidovirus uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) and 29-Omethyltransferase (29-O-MTase). Two other domains are as yet uncharacterized and unique to either roniviruses [ronivirus-specific domain (RsD)] or arteriviruses [arterivirus-specific domain (AsD)]. As five of the six lineagespecific domains occupy a unique position in the genome, the pattern of their conservation could be explained by loss or acquisition of a single domain during nidovirus evolution (Nga et al., 2011) . The exception is AsD, which resides in the most C-terminal subunit of the arterivirus ORF1b polyprotein (nsp12), the position occupied by the 29-O-MTase protein in all other nidoviruses (nsp16 in coronaviruses; Fig. 1 ). If these positionally equivalent proteins are unrelated, as reported 14 years ago based on the analysis of only a few genome sequences and prior to the identification of the 29-O-MTase (Gorbalenya, 2001) , their emergence would require the consideration of complex evolutionary hypotheses. Thus, the relation of AsD with the 29-O-MTase and other proteins must be re-evaluated whilst taking advantage 1 0 1 11 2 6-8 nsp Fig. 1 .

Two other coronavirus enzymes, HEL1 (nsp13) (Ivanov et al., 2004; Ivanov & Ziebuhr, 2004) and the N7-MTase (nsp14) (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009) , are also suspected or known to be involved in capping, whereas the fourth enzyme required (guanylyltransferase) remains to be identified. In vitro, the coronavirus N7-MTase and 29-O-MTase were found to cooperate during cap formation. The latter enzyme also requires the ORF1a-encoded nsp10 as a co-factor (Bouvet et al., 2010) . Although arteriviruses were not characterized in detail, the SHFV genome was reported to be capped (Sagripanti et al., 1986) and they do encode a HEL1 (Seybert et al., 2000) , which could contribute to capping. Thus, the discovery of arteriviral N7-MTase and/or 29-O-MTase activities could be readily accommodated in a functionally sensible manner.",

No statistically significant similarity was found between arterivirus nsp12 and coronavirus nsp16 or other proteins although the two nidovirus proteins may belong to the same a/b-fold class. Likewise, no MTase activity was detected in carefully controlled assays using recombinant EAV nsp12 in the absence or presence of several other nsps that were included as potential co-factors. Using reverse genetics, a large set of EAV nsp12 mutants was generated and tested for replication, revealing phenotypes ranging from WT-like to replication-deficient, which broadly correlated with the natural variation of the probed residues. We conclude that nsp12 plays an essential role in EAV replication and discuss possible directions to elucidate its enigmatic function.",

We also noted the presence of four conserved cysteines in a pattern typical for zinc fingers in the C-terminal part of nsp12 in the five simian arteriviruses, which constitute a phylogenetically compact cluster. Patristic pair-wise distances (PPDs) of nsp12 compared with those of ZBD, HEL1 and NendoU were consistently larger, whilst PPDs of (putative) 29-O-MTases were comparable on average with those of five other domains in the coronaviruses and toroviruses (Fig.  S1 , available in the online Supplementary Material). These results showed that, in comparison with the coronavirus 29-O-MTase, nsp12 must have evolved under unusually relaxed constraints or in a changing molecular environment. Secondary structure predictions using JPred and PSIPRED consistently indicated the alternation of ahelices and b-strands in arterivirus nsp12 (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the coronavirus MTases also belong to the a/b structural class and contain conserved aromatic residues (Chen et al., 2011; Decroly et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, HH-suite profile-profile comparison did not reveal sequence similarity above the background between nsp12 and the 29-O-MTase of coronaviruses or toroviruses, E 5 0.41 and 0.53, respectively (Fig. S2 ). Furthermore, these proteins are also of different sizes: 119-178 (arterivirus nsp12) versus 263-312 aa (coronavirus nsp16), with the arterivirus proteins being also smaller than MTases of other origins. The above HHbased negative result contrasted with the strong similarity signal observed in (control) comparisons between arteriviruses and coronaviruses or toroviruses for HEL1 and NendoU (Ej3.5|10 -17 ) or in the control comparison between coronavirus and torovirus nsp16, E 5 2.3|10 -32 (Fig. S2 ). No statistically significant similarity was observed between nsp12 and other proteins in a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based scan of the Pfam-A database (top hit: PF12581, E 5 1.0). We thus concluded that nsp12 has diverged beyond recognition from its homologues and differs considerably from the 29-O-MTase of large nidoviruses. Nevertheless, the results obtained did not rule out the possibility that it could be a deviant MTase, and we therefore set out to test this hypothesis experimentally by biochemical and molecular virological methods.",

In agreement with the published results (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2013) , both SARS-CoV MTases (kindly provided by Dr Etienne Decroly, AFMB, Marseille, France), which were used as positive controls, transferred the radioactive methyl group from the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine to non-methylated or N7-methylated cap analogues (Fig. 5) . Likewise, vaccinia virus capping enzyme, obtained from a commercial source and known to harbour N7-MTase activity, also demonstrated the expected activity. Based on these activities and the results of two negative control reactions (assays using BSA and no acceptor), we defined an incorporation threshold of 1000 c.p.m. to distinguish the enzyme activity in this assay. According to this definition, EAV nsp12 did not display activity with any of the methyl acceptors in the absence or presence of any of the potential ORF1aencoded co-factors described above (nsp6-7, nsp6-7-8, nsp7a, nsp7b and nsp7).

As expected, this group included the three poorly conserved control residues (S25, S30 and Y32). Nevertheless, S30A exhibited a small-plaque phenotype (Fig. 6) . Unexpectedly, we also repeatedly observed the pseudo-reversion of Y32A to Y32V, which required only a single nucleotide change. Although valine is not amongst the naturally occurring amino acid residues at this position (Fig. 3) , a hydrophobic residue is observed in several arteriviruses other than EAV. In addition to substitutions of these control residues, EAV also tolerated the substitution of S56 with alanine or threonine. Given the strict conservation of serine and threonine, this lack of impact was the expected outcome for S56T, but was rather surprising for S56A. Finally, S45A was stable and indistinguishable from the parental virus, whilst S45T reverted. Together with the sequence variation at this position, which is limited to the small amino acids glycine, alanine and serine, this probably indicates a certain degree of steric hindrance by any residue larger than serine. Overall, the observed mutant phenotypes were compatible with the natural variation observed at the respective positions, with the possible exception of the C84Y mutant. These correlations supported the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the highly variable nsp12 and suggested that EAV replication in BHK-21 is a faithful model system for probing nsp12 function by mutagenesis.",

Reflecting the conservation of several aromatic residues in arteriviruses, substitution with alanine was not tolerated in any of the cases, whereas more conservative substitutions maintaining the residue's aromatic nature were tolerated in most of the partially conserved positions (Table 1 ). The only exception was F107Y, which interestingly showed a certain level of protein expression, but did not produce infectious progeny. As two arteriviruses distantly related to EAV, LDV and PRRSV genotype 1, naturally encode a tyrosine at this position (Fig. 3) , this result suggests an epistatic interaction between residue 107 and other unknown residue(s). EAV also did not tolerate a block of nsp12 expression (STOP mutant) or the replacement of its single absolutely conserved nsp12 residue, F109, with alanine or tyrosine. This phenotype could be explained by a trans-dominant negative effect of these mutations on an interaction partner of nsp12, if this partner is essential for EAV replication. This explanation is also compatible with the non-viable phenotype of several other mutants and suggests a particularly important role of the most constrained and proximal F107 and F109 in such a putative interaction.",

In this context, a future in-depth analysis of the nsp12 interaction network could be most informative. If nsp12 is not an MTase, this activity must be provided by another protein, but it is unlikely to be one of the three other ORF1b proteins, which are known to possess non-MTase enzymatic activities. This implies that arteriviruses may be (very) different from other nidoviruses with respect to either the nature of the 59 end of their mRNAs and/or the mechanism generating it. We note that the presence of a 59-terminal cap-1 structure was reported for the SHFV genome (Sagripanti et al., 1986) , but that monophosphates were claimed to present at the 59 end of LDV mRNAs (Chen et al., 1994) , calling for additional studies to resolve the apparent conflict. Finally, the possibility of cap-snatching, the strategy employed by some families of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Fujimura & Esteban, 2011; Mir et al., 2008; Reich et al., 2014) , may be explored for arteriviruses. This mechanism might accommodate the nsp11 NendoU as endoribonuclease and nsp12 as a cap-binding protein, which would connect coronavirus nsp16 and arterivirus nsp12 to a common target in an unorthodox way.",

Codon-based MSAs of virus genomes were produced using the Viralis platform , and assisted by HMMER 3.1 (Finn et al., 2011) , MUSCLE 3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004) and CLUSTAL W 2.012 (Larkin et al., 2007) . Only one virus per established or tentative species, which were defined with the help of DEmARC1.3 (Lauber & Gorbalenya, 2012) , was retained for bioinformatics analyses. SNAD (Sidorov et al., 2009 ) was used to retrieve information about genomes. To reveal the full extent of similarity between pairs of alignments, they were converted into HMM profiles, which were compared and visualized in a dot-plot fashion using a routine in HH-suite 2.0.15 (Remmert et al., 2012; S\u00f6ding, 2005) . Distribution of similarity density in alignments was plotted using R package Bio3D (Grant et al., 2006) under the conservation assessment method SIMILARITY, substitution matrix Blosum62 (Henikoff & Henikoff, 1992 ) and a sliding window of 11 alignment columns. HHsuite 2.0.15 (Remmert et al., 2012; S\u00f6ding, 2005) was used to search for homologues amongst profiles in the Pfam-A database (Finn et al., 2014) ; the secondary structure of proteins was predicted by applying JPred 3 (Cole et al., 2008) and PSIPRED (Buchan et al., 2013) to MSAs. The MSAs were converted into figures using ESPript (Robert & Gouet, 2014) . Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees was performed using PhyML 3.0, with the WAG amino acid substitution matrix (Whelan & Goldman, 2001) , allowing substitution rate heterogeneity amongst sites (four categories) and 1000 iterations of non-parametric bootstrapping (Guindon et al., 2010) .

To verify the presence of the introduced mutations or reversions in viable mutants, fresh BHK-21 cells were infected with supernatants harvested at time points at which transfected cells were positive in immunofluorescence microscopy. RNA was isolated after 18 h or when a cytopathic effect was detected. Finally, the nsp12-coding region was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using random hexameric primers in the RT step and EAV-specific primers for the PCR.

Cells were resuspended in nsp12 resuspension buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol) or co-factor resuspension buffer [20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 % glycerol (v/v), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol] containing 500 mM NaCl and Roche complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysis was achieved by 30 min incubation with lysozyme (0.1 mg ml 21 ). Genomic DNA was sheared during four sonication cycles of 10 s with intermittent cooling. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 20 min. Cleared supernatants were incubated with an appropriate amount of Talon beads for 1 h under slow rolling. Beads were collected and washed four times for 15 min with a 20-fold volume of the respective resuspension buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, and first 500 mM, then 250 mM and finally twice 100 mM NaCl. Proteins were eluted with the respective resuspension buffer containing 300 mM imidazole and 100 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialysed against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 25 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT. All proteins were stored at 220 uC. Typical yields were 1-2 mg l 21 culture for all proteins. Protein concentrations were calculated based on theoretical extinction coefficients and A 280 .",

Additionally 7.5 mM NaCl was carried over from the protein storage buffer. Vaccinia virus capping enzyme (New England Biolabs) was incubated in the buffer supplied by the vendor. A 10-fold volume of ice-cold S-adenosylhomocysteine (100 mM) was added to stop the reaction. Samples were spotted on DEAE filtermats (Perkin Elmer), which were subsequently washed twice with 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8.0, then twice with water and finally with ethanol. Filtermats were cut and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting.",
