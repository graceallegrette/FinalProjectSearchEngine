Outside China, the disease spread worldwide, nearly 13,570 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and 270 patients had died from infection by this novel virus [3] . The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) that endangers international public health [4] . The WHO has defined a PHEIC as an infectious disease with international spread, or an unusual, serious, or unexpected public health event that exceeds local health resources, or that requires immediate international action [4] .",

Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of novel infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), can increase anxiety, depression, and stress levels in the general population [5] . These negative emotions also affect sleep [6] . At the time of the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, some individuals with mild illness, suspected cases of infection, and people who had been in close contact with patients or a potentially high-risk environment were isolated at home. Even if the self-isolated individuals do not develop an infection and remain physically well, they often suffer from negative psychological effects. Importantly, the effects of mental health and sleep on immunity have been shown by previous studies [7] . Good quality sleep can help improve immunity to viral infection [8] . Therefore, mental health and sleep quality are important considerations in the population of people who have self-isolated due to their increased risk of COVID-19 infection.",

In 1997, Lynch developed the concept of social capital as the will to generate social cohesion, trust, and participation in community activities [14] . There are differences between social support and social capital. Social support represents the size and source of social networks of people helping others, as well as emotional, material, and informative supportive functions [15] . Social capital includes social trust, belonging, and social participation. The effect of social capital on psychological wellbeing has been shown by previous studies [16] .",

People who have more social capital usually have less stress because they have spiritual or material support from others. Social support helps to reduce the perception and evaluation of the threat of stress events, the physiological response and inappropriate behavior caused by stress, and the level of fear and anxiety induced by stress [33, 34] . Stress is associated with sleep quality [35] . When individuals experience stress, they often feel physical tension and mental pressure, they are more sensitive to the sleeping environment, or they focus on sleep too much, which will reduce their sleep quality [36] . Also, some variables may interact with each other. For example, anxiety may increase stress, and stress may increase anxiety [37] . Also, increased anxiety may lead to poor sleep, and poor sleep may increase anxiety [38] .

For example, professional medical staff should provide online health education to reduce uncertainty and panic caused by a lack of knowledge of new infections and diseases. Social workers and psychotherapists may provide online help or support or support by phone to provide encouragement to communicate with relatives and friends using the internet or phone. These approaches to improving mental health and sleep may also improve immune function, which may improve the ability to resist infectious disease [39, 40] . This study investigated social capital, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality in a population who self-isolated for 14 days during the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020 and analyzed the relationships between the variables. Social capital affected sleep quality through the mediation effects on anxiety and stress, as people who had high levels of social capital had better sleep quality. However, this study had several limitations. The study sample size was small, and a cross-sectional study design was used, which may have prevented the identification of other associations between social capital and sleep. Also, social capital was measured using the PSCI-16 questionnaire, and the data relied on the ability of the individual to interpret the questions and provide accurate responses, but these responses were not verified objectively. Therefore, some causal relationships may have been missed. Further cohort studies with more samples should be performed, and non-subjective methods should be used. For example, sleep can be measured objectively by polysomnography, and stress levels can be detected using objective measurements of serum cortisol levels.",

In this study, path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables (anxiety, stress, and sleep), using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress. These findings may have implications for public health provision during epidemics of infectious disease, including improvements in social capital.",
