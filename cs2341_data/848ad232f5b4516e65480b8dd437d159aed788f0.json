International travel has facilitated the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. As of March 13 th , 2020, 118 countries, territories, and areas have reported COVID-19 cases, however, differences in patterns and intensity of transmission ranges were observed [2] . In February and early March in Korea, a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases were observed, with most infections in specific clusters and geographical regions.",

The difference in age distribution of COVID-19 cases compared with China may reflect active surveillance of a cluster of religious groups tied to the outbreak. A summary of the epidemiological characteristics of the first 7,755 COVID-19 cases in Korea confirms the contagiousness of COVID-19 that led to a nationwide outbreak in a few weeks. Triaging patients for hospitalization, social distancing (to reduce the number of contacts), and reporting the outbreak amongst vulnerable people in the population may have played a role in the recent decline in cases of COVID-19. However, in the initial response to COVID-19, quarantine, early detection, and isolation of suspected cases of COVID-19, may have contributed to lowering the wave of this epidemic in other parts of Korea. More severe cases were reported in the elderly with existing comorbidities, which warrants clear triage management and a high-risk approach in healthcare access prioritization. COVID-19 does not appear to be fatal among young adults and children, however their role in disease transmission should be further assessed. This summary may help in the understanding of early phase disease dynamics for the COVID-19 outbreak, and guide future public health measures in other countries.",
