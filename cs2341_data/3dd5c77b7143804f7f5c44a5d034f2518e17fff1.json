Further animal experimental results showed that rAd-PEDV-S elicited a significant PEDV-specific humoral immune response after vaccination (P < 0.05). In addition, rAd-PEDV-S provided partial protection for pigs against the highly virulent PEDV challenge. e results presented in this study indicate that the adenovirus vector can be used as a vaccine delivery vector for the development of a PEDV vaccine and is a promising novel vaccine candidate for future prevention and control of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), but its efficacy still needs to be improved in the future.",

PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and its genome is approximately 28 kb in length and is composed of seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6) [3, 4] . Four structural proteins, namely, the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and one accessory protein, ORF3, are encoded by ORF2-6 [4, 5] . Among the structural proteins, the S protein is the major envelope glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and cell membrane fusion and entry [6, 7] . erefore, the S protein is considered the main target for neutralizing antibodies against PEDV and has been frequently used in phylogenetic analysis, establishment of serologic diagnostic methods, and development of new vaccines.",

Similar to the levels of serological IgG and IgA antibodies, the results of the VN test revealed that immunization IM with rAd-PEDV-S also elicited VN responses against PEDV in all vaccinated pigs (Figure 2(c) ). Meanwhile, no VN responses were detected in the pigs of the Adblank and PBS groups (Figure 2(c) ).

Currently, recombinant live vector vaccines are a new hot research topic in the development of vaccines and have been widely applied in many human and animal vaccine development attempts [31, 32] . In the recent work on development of a PEDV vaccine, several recombinant live vector vaccines based on the PEDV S protein were constructed successively [19, 22, 23] . ese recombinant live vector vaccines both elicited protective immunity against the PEDV challenge in piglets and demonstrated the potential of recombinant live vectors as a vaccine delivery platform capable of eliciting passive immunity against PEDV. erefore, in this study, a recombinant adenovirus expressing the spike protein of genotype GIIa PEDV was constructed successfully, and its immunogenicity and protective efficiency as a vaccine candidate were evaluated in 4-week-old pigs. e coding sequence of the S protein used in this study was derived from the highly virulent Chinese genotype GIIa PEDV strain CH/HBXT/2018 (GenBank accession number MH816969), which was isolated by our laboratory and propagated in Vero cells. e strain has high pathogenicity in piglets, with a high mortality of almost 100% in infected suckling piglets, and causes a serious clinical disease with symptoms such as watery diarrhea [28] . An antigenic analysis showed that the S1 region, especially within the NTD, was highly homologous with that of current field strains. Based on these characteristics, the strain CH/HBXT/ 2018 was selected as a candidate for use in the development of a novel PEDV vaccine. Although the adenovirus-expressing vectors show more advantages than other vectors, such as easy construction, higher efficiency of gene transfer, higher titers, and strong induction of humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses, the strong immune responses induced by adenovirus proteins result in poor vaccine efficacy [25, 27] . e same result can also be found in this study. Although rAd-PEDV-S could induce high levels of specific antibodies, its efficacy was limited.",

However, in the next study, rAd-PEDV-S should be used to immunize pregnant sows to determine whether it produces sIgA antibodies that are secreted in the colostrum and milk and ultimately transferred to suckling piglets (gut-mammary-sIgA axis). In this study, pigs from all four groups were challenged orally with 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 highly virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain CH/HNPJ/2017 at 28 dpv. After the challenge, typical clinical signs of PEDV infection were observed in all four groups from 1 to 7 dpi. e results demonstrated that rAd-PEDV-S and the inactivated vaccine could markedly delay clinical signs, reduce virus shedding, and provide partial protection against the highly virulent PEDV challenge. e possible reasons for the low protective efficacy of rAd-PEDV-S and the inactivated vaccine in pigs are as follows: the inoculation dose in pigs in the challenge study was relatively higher than that in most of the previous PEDV animal experiments. Generally, most PEDV animal experiments use 100 TCID 50 virus as an inoculum. However, here, 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 highly virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain was used as the inoculum in the pig challenge study. Although our previous study determined that the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD 50 ) of the challenge strain CH/HNPJ/ 2017 was 8.63 log 10 PDD 50 /3 mL at 7 dpi, the experimental animals were 4-day-old conventional suckling pigs [28] . erefore, the challenge inoculum dose in the present study cannot be completely in accordance with the previous PDD 50 . e results of this study indicated that a suitable inoculum dose is very important for a PEDV infection study and should be determined in advance in various ages of pigs.",
