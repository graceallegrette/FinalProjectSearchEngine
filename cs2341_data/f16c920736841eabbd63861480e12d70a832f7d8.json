Collected \u00dfies were subdivided into pools and homogenized in brain-heart infusion broth with antibiotics. The separated supernatant was tested for the presence of ENDV by inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs. Exotic Newcastle disease virus was isolated from pools of Phaenicia cuprina (Wiedemann), Fannia canicularis (L.), and Musca domestica L., and it was identi\u00deed by hemagglutination inhibition with Newcastle disease virus antiserum. Viral concentration in positive pools was low (\u03fd1 egg infectious dose 50 per \u00dfy). Isolated virus demonstrated identical monoclonal antibody binding pro\u00deles as well as 99% sequence homology in the 635-bp fusion gene sequence compared with ENDV recovered from infected commercial egg layer poultry during the 2002 outbreak.",

Sweep net collections continued at each home until \u00dfies were no longer readily captured. Captured insects were killed on dry ice, placed into labeled vials by using sterilized forceps, and held on dry ice until they could be returned to the laboratory to be identi\u00deed and counted.

Virus isolation was performed by inoculating 100 l of the supernatant into the allantois of each of three 9-or 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Eggs were incubated at 37\u040aC in a standard humidi\u00deed incubator. The embryonated chicken eggs were obtained from the SEPRL speci\u00dec-pathogen-free White Leghorn \u00dfock. Eggs were candled to determine embryo death each 24 h through 7 d postinoculation. Embryos that died within the \u00derst 24 h were discarded. Embryos that died between 24 h and 7 d as well as all survivors at 7 d were chilled at 4\u040aC. Amnio-allantoic \u00dfuid (AAF) harvested from chilled eggs was tested for hemagglutination (HA) activity to detect ENDV. Virus presence in HApositive samples was con\u00dermed by hemagglutinationinhibition (HI) with Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV)-speci\u00dec antiserum (King 1996a) . Amnio-allantoic \u00dfuids from HA negative dead embryos and embryos alive at 7 d postinoculation were subjected to a second serial pas-sage by inoculation of 100 l of the AAF into each of three additional embryonated chicken eggs. Eggs were candled, and killed embryos were handled as before. If by day 7 postinoculation there was no HA activity in the AAF of the second passage dead or surviving embryos, the specimen was regarded as negative for ENDV.",

Given the small numbers of \u00dfies collected, the prevalence of ENDV-infected \u00dfies was high with \u03f730% of the pools containing the three species mentioned above having one or more \u00dfies per pool infected with virus. The virus prevalence in Fannia spp. collected from commercial poultry operations during the 1971 END outbreak was far lower with only two of 78 pools of Fannia spp. (3,926 total \u00dfies) collected before or within 2 d of poultry removal containing ENDV, and no virus was recovered from other common \u00dfy species (Rogoff et al. 1975) . It is unclear to what extent Rogoff et al. (1975) may have collected \u00dfies from poultry facilities where poultry or even manure had already been removed from the site, perhaps resulting in the much lower ENDV infection prevalence in \u00dfies relative to this study. The higher ENDV prevalence in this study also may be due to differences between commercial poultry and backyard poultry in animal housing, manure handling, or vaccination status of the poultry against Newcastle disease virus. Backyard poultry are often housed together on the ground or in wooden boxes, giving them greater access to an infected bird and its manure relative to commercial egg-layer poultry that are separated into cages suspended above the ground where the manure is allowed to accumulate. Additionally, backyard poultry are usually not vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus and infected ",

It has been shown that ENDV-infected poultry shed a considerable amount of virus in their feces (Kapczynski and King 2005) and that virus can persist in the manure for up to 16 d . Wet manure provides an excellent developmental environment for several \u00dfy species as well as a substrate on which adult \u00dfies feed. Manure also provides an excellent media for maintaining and transmitting infectious agents to \u00dfies as the viscosity of the manure enhances manure attachment to \u00dfy tarsi and cuticular bristles (Tan et al. 1997 ). In addition, \u00dfies feeding on bacteria in the manure would be expected to consume some amount of the infectious agent. Further studies are needed to determine whether ENDV is associated with these \u00dfy species simply as an external contaminant or if the virus is protected or even ampli\u00deed within the gut or other tissues of the \u00dfy. Shane et al. (1985) demonstrated the potential for house \u00dfies to transmit pathogens by placing \u00dfies into cages with Campylobacter jejuni-infected chickens and subsequently moving the \u00dfies to cages with pathogen-free chickens, resulting in C. jejuni infection in the previously uninfected chickens. Similarly, turkey poults housed in isolation units became infected with turkey corona virus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, TCV) when house \u00dfies orally inoculated with TCV were released into the isolation units for 24 h (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003) , and cattle held in con\u00dened pens became infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7 after house \u00dfies orally inoculated with the bacteria were released into the pens for 48 h (Ahmad et al. 2007 ). However, the actual mechanism of bacterial transmission from the \u00dfies to the chickens or cattle in the studies mentioned above remains unknown.",

(1974) . Fly control measures would be especially important for a quarantined poultry facility (to include backyard \u00dfocks) before removal of birds and their manure by a state and/or federal task force as part of the disease eradication effort. Removal of birds and manure would be expected to encourage \u00dfy dispersal into the surrounding area. It is recommended that future END task force organizations consider the use of insecticides providing rapid knockdown of adult \u00dfies immediately before initiating eradication efforts at commercial and backyard poultry facilities and that control measures continue throughout the period of manure removal and site disinfection.",
