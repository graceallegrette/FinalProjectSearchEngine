A mature SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, namely, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) 10 . All these proteins may serve as antigens to stimulate neutralizing antibodies and increase CD4 + / CD8 + T-cell responses 8, 9 . However, subunit vaccines require multiple booster shots and suitable adjuvants to work, and certain subunit vaccines such as hepatitis B surface antigen, PreS1, and PreS2 may fail to yield protective response when tested clinically 11 . The DNA and mRNA vaccines that are easier to design and proceed into clinical trials very quickly remain experimental. The viral vector-based vaccines could also be quickly constructed and used without an adjuvant 12 . However, development of such vaccines might not start until antigens containing the neutralizing epitopes are identified 8 .",

            "text": "The E and M proteins have important functions in the viral assembly of a coronavirus, and the N protein is necessary for viral RNA synthesis 13 . Deletion of E protein abrogated the virulence of CoVs, and several studies have explored the potential of recombinant SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV with a mutated E protein as live attenuated vaccines 13, 14 . The M protein can augment the immune response induced by N protein DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV; 15 however, the conserved N protein across CoV families implies that it is not a suitable candidate for vaccine development, and the antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 do not provide immunity to the infection 16 . The critical glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for virus binding and entry 16 . The S precursor protein of SARS-CoV-2 can be proteolytically cleaved into S1 (685 aa) and S2 (588 aa) subunits 10 . The S2 protein is well conserved among SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares 99% identity with that of bat SARS-CoVs 10 . The vaccine design based on the S2 protein may boost the broad-spectrum antiviral effect and is worth testing in animal models. Antibodies against the conserved stem region of influenza hemagglutinin have been found to exhibit broadly cross-reactive immunity, but are less potent in neutralizing influenza A virus 17 . In contrast, the S1 subunit consists of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus entry into sensitive cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 18 . The S1 protein of 2019-nCoV shares about 70% identity with that of human SARS-CoVs. The highest number of variations of amino acids in the RBD is located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction between virus and host receptor 10, 18 . Blocking the initial entry of a virus is proposed as a successful strategy in controlling viral infection. Based on SARS vaccine development, most vaccine candidates target the S protein, which induces neutralizing antibody responses and stimulates a protective cellular immunity against SARS-CoVs 12 . Bukreyev et al. 19 showed that immunization of African green monkeys with the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV protects monkeys from subsequent homologous SARS-CoV challenge. Administration of SARS-CoV RBD proteins can also induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity in animal models 20 . Thus, the generation of antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 would be an important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials 10 .",

In addition to the entire virus particleassociated inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines, the subunit candidates, such as S1 protein and/or the RBD element of SARS-CoV-2, are also valuable targets for vaccine design. Combining subunit vaccines with established or new adjuvants such as alum versus modern adjuvants such as the GSK AS series of adjuvants may represent a faster and safer strategy to move through early clinical development with the caveat that the protective efficacy may not be strong enough. As a result, immunizing the subunit vaccines with proper delivery platforms and immunization strategies to enhance the immune responses should be considered. We expect researchers who are racing against time will bring a new SARS-CoV-2-based vaccine from gene sequence to clinical testing in approximately 16-20 weeks.",
