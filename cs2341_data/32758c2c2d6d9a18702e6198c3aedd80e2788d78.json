Although the L type (~70%) is more prevalent than the S type (~30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 .",

Since then, it has rapidly spread across China and in other countries, raising major global concerns. The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, named for the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome. As of February 28, 2020, 78,959 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in China, with 2,791 deaths. Worryingly, there have also been more than 3,664 confirmed cases outside of China in 46 countries and areas (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), raising significant doubts about the likelihood of successful containment. Further, the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a number of patients share sequence identity higher than 99.9%, suggesting a very recent host shift into humans [1] [2] [3] .",

Indeed, it has been postulated that most of the coronaviruses in humans are derived from the bat reservoir [6, 7] . Unsurprisingly, several teams have recently confirmed the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat betacoronavirus of the sub-genus Sarbecovirus [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The whole-genome sequence identity of the novel virus has 96.2% similarity to a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) collected in Yunnan province, China [2, 14] , but is not very similar to the genomes of SARS-CoV (about 79%) or MERS-CoV (about 50%) [1, 15] . It has also been confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), as the SARS-CoV [11] . Although the specific route of transmission from natural reservoirs to humans remains unclear [5, 13] , several studies have shown that pangolins may have provided a partial spike gene to SARS-CoV-2; the critical functional sites in the spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 are nearly identical to one identified in a virus isolated from a pangolin [16] [17] [18] .",

Notably, we found that the nucleotide divergence at synonymous sites between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was much higher than previously anticipated. For example, although the overall genomic nucleotides overall differ ~4% between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the genomic average dS was 0.17, which means the divergence at the neutral sites is 17% between these two viruses (Table 1) . This is because the nonsynonymous sites are usually under stronger negative selection than synonymous sites, and calculating sequence differences without separating these two classes of sites may underestimate the extent of molecular divergence by several folds.",

In particular, the spike gene (S) consistently exhibited larger dS values than other genes (Table 1 ). This pattern became clear when we calculated the dS value for each branch in Fig. 1A for the spike gene versus the concatenated sequences of the remaining genes ( Fig.   S2 ). In each branch, the dS of spike was 2.22 \u00b1 1.35 (mean \u00b1 SD) times as large as that of the other genes. This extremely elevated dS value of spike could be caused either by a high mutation rate or by natural selection that favors synonymous substitutions. Synonymous substitutions may serve as another layer of genetic regulation, guiding the efficiency of mRNA translation by changing codon usage [21] . If positive selection is the driving force for the higher synonymous substation rate seen in spike, we expect the frequency of optimal codons (FOP) of spike to be different from that of other genes. However, our codon usage bias analysis (Table S2 ) suggests the FOP of spike was only slightly higher than that of the genomic average (0.717 versus 0.698, see Materials and Methods). Thus, we believe that the elevated synonymous substitution rate measured in spike is more likely caused by higher mutational rates; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.",

These human intervention efforts might have caused severe selective pressure against the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. The S type, on the other hand, might have experienced weaker selective pressure by human intervention, leading to an increase in its relative abundance among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Thus, we hypothesized that the two types of SARS-CoV-2 viruses might have experienced different selective pressures due to different epidemiological features.

However, negative selection appears to be the predominant force acting on these viruses. Interestingly, the virus isolated from one patient in Shenzhen on January 13, 2020 (SZ_2020/01/13.a, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_406592) had C at both positions 8,782 and 28,144 in the genome, belonging to neither L nor S type ( Fig. 4A and 5) . Notably, this strain had one stop-gain mutation in orf1ab and had accumulated 20 silent and 5 nonsynonymous mutations after diverging from the ancestor haplotype (Fig. 4A ). Thus, it is possible that functional constraints on the genomic sequence were weakened after the disruption of orf1ab in this strain. Notably, on viruses isolated from a patient living in South Korean (Skorea_2020/01.a, GISAID: EPI_ISL_411929), acquired six nonsynonymous mutations that were different from the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2: orf1ab (M902I and T6891M), S (S221W), ORF3a (W128L and G251V), and E (L37H). If these changes are not due to sequencing errors, it would be interesting to test whether and how these mutations affect the transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",

It is also unclear whether the L type is more virulent than the S type. orf1ab, which encodes replicase/transcriptase, is required for viral genome replication and might also be important for viral pathogenesis [36] . Although the T8517C mutation in orf1ab does not change the protein sequence (it changes the codon AGT (Ser) to AGC (Ser)), we hypothesized this mutation might affect orf1ab translation since AGT is preferred while AGC is unpreferred (Table S2 ). ORF8 promotes the expression of ATF6, the ER unfolded protein response factor, in human cells [37] .

In other words, 87.6% to 95.6% of the nonsynonymous mutations were removed by negative selection during viral evolution. To determine the extent of positive selection, we concatenated the CDS sequences of 9 conserved ORFs in all the viruses in Fig. 1A and fitted the M7 (beta: neutral and negative selection) and M8 (beta + \u03c9>1:neutral, negative selection, and positive selection) model using CODEML (Materials and Methods). The M8 model (lnL = -104,813.732, np =18) was a significantly better fit than the M7 (lnL = -105,063.284, np = 16) model (P < 10 -10 ), suggesting that some AA substitutions were favored by positive Darwinian selection (but not necessarily in the SARS-CoV-2 lineage).Under the M8 model, 98.48% (p 0 ) of the nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated under neutral evolution or purifying selection (0\u2a7d\u03c9\u2a7d1), and 1.52% (p 1 ) of the nonsynonymous substitutions were under positive selection (\u03c9 = 1.50). A Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis suggested that 10 AA sitesshowed strong signals of positive selection, and, interestingly, three of those were located in the RBD of spike, including at one critical site (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4). Thus, although these coronaviruses were generally under very strong negative selection, positive selection was also responsible for the evolution of protein sequences. The putatively positively-selected sites might serve as candidates for further functional studies.",

In our recent publication (https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036), we showed that among circulating SARS-CoV-2 (with 103 genomes analyzed) two different viral genomes co-exist. We identified them as lineages L and S. The concerned amino acid we used to define the L and S lineages is located in ORF8 (open reading frame 8), which plays a yet undefined role in the viral life cycle. Based on the finding that \"L\" lineage has a higher frequency than lineage S, we described the L lineage as aggressive. We now recognize that within the context of our study the term \"aggressive\" is misleading and should be replaced by a more precise term \"a higher frequency\". In short, while we have shown that the two lineages naturally co-exist, we provided no evidence supporting any epidemiological conclusion regarding the virulence or pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. By saying so, corrections will be made in the print version of this paper to avoid being misleading. ",
