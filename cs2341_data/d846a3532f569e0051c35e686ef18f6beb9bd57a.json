On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic [1] . In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020 [2] . It has attracted a great attention since published. Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated. For instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed. Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al. [9] , they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience. Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide. We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
