This disease has spread to several other countries, most confirmed cases have displayed symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness and many of these patients have died. This research is aimed to construct a mathematical model for the transmission of MERS-CoV in two areas by separating the human population into two groups; susceptible and infectious groups. The dynamics of the disease is studied by a compartmental model involving ordinary differrential equations. The basic reproductive number of this disease is discussed to control the outbreak of this disease. Sensitivity analysis of this model is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the MERS-CoV transmission.",

It can cause severe acute respiratory disease, particularly in people with underlying conditions. The MERS-CoV is a potential pandemic disease, cases of this disease has been reported in some countries. As of 11 September 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) global case count was 1,569 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV, including at least 554 deaths (case fatality rate 35.31%) since the first cases were reported in September 2012 (WHO, 2015). All cases have had a history of residence in or travel to the Middle East (>90% Saudi Arabia), or contact with travellers returning from these areas (L. M. Gardner and C. R. MacIntyre, 2014).

Models for infectious disease are helpful for prevention and control of emerging infectious disease like MERS-CoV. Here a SISI (S for susceptible and I for infectious) epidemiological model for human to human in two areas describing MERS-CoV disease transmission is presented, as well as the associated basic reproductive number. Firstly, we formulate a SISI model to describe the transmission of MERS-CoV in two areas. Next, we evaluate the basic reproductive number using the next generation matrix method. Basic reproductive number is discussed in order to identify influential model parameters, so with controlling parameters in it, the outbreak of the disease can be eliminated. Finally, we analyze sensitivity of the model in order to determine the influence of the input parameters on the model outputs. Based on this analysis, we can find which parameters are most sensitive to the MERS-CoV transmission model.",

Sensitivity analysis is often used to study how the variation in the output of a model can be apportioned, qualitatively or quantitavely, to different sources of variation, and of how the given model depends on the information fed into it (A. Saltelli, et al., 2000) .

Equilibrium point represents the situation where only * and * exist and it is called disease free equilibrium (DFE) point whereas equilibrium point depicts the situation where all population exist and it is called endemic equilibrium (EE) point. BASIC REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER Basic reproductive number is an important threshold in mathematical epidemiology. This threshold conditions determine whether an infectious disease will spread in a susceptible population when the disease is introduced into the population (O. Diekmann and J. A. P. Heesterbeek, 2000). The threshold is calculated by using the spectral radius of a next generation (infection) matrix of a model (P. van den Driessche and J. Watmough, 2002). It is given mathematically as = ( ) where is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix , is the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment , and is the transfer of individuals out of compartment by all other means. Given the DFE . Basic reproductive number is calculated as the largest eigenvalue (spectral radius) of the matrix of partial derivatives (Z. Ma and J. Li, 2009):",
