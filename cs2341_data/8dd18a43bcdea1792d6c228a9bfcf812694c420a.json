Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases. Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed. We hope that our experience in prevention and control of COVID-19 can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.",

This has caused serious harm to people's health and a huge economic burden [1] . As of March 23, 2020, a total of 332,930 patients were confirmed positive of the disease and 14,510 died worldwide [2] . The World Health Organization has increased the assessment of the risk of spread and impact of CO-VID-19 to very high at the global level [3] . COVID-19 is characterized by strong infectivity, rapid spread, and general susceptibility, which brought a great challenge to spine surgery. Optimizing the diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases under the condition of blocking the pandemic transmission is a problem that spine surgeons need to solve. This paper summarized the recent experiences in spine surgery and provided recommendations on how to carry out the standardized diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 via the S protein on its surface, with 10-20 times higher affinity than SARS [5] . The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 3-7 days and no more than 14 days, while it can also last up to 24 days in rare cases. Confirmed, asymptomatic, and incubation period patients are the sources of infection. The transmission route mainly includes respiratory droplets and direct contact, but the possibility of aerosol propagation and vertical propagation is not excluded [6] .",

To ensure the safety of patients and health care workers, spine surgeons need to follow standard procedures of diagnosis and treatment. Based on the actual work of spinal outpatient and emergency departments and the suggestions of other orthopedic practitioners, outpatient, and emergency management procedures for patients with spinal diseases during the epidemic of CO-VID-19 were formulated. We hope to provide a reference for the first-line medical staff in blocking viral transmission and improving treatment of spinal diseases.",

Mild patients are mainly treated conservatively to relieve symptoms and psychologically counseled. For the critical spinal patients, the aim should be saving lives and preserve spinal cord function and adopt surgical treatment if necessary. Patients should appropriately reduce the number of hospital revisits and try to use the Internet for online consulting. Noncritical surgery should be avoided during the pandemic. Patients requiring elective surgery can be operated after the pandemic is under control.Because of mobility limitations caused by spinal diseases, prolonged bed rest can aggravate the underlying diseases and lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infection, and osteoporosis. Previous studies have shown that older populations with underlying diseases have significantly increased susceptibility to COVID-19 and relatively poor prognosis[11]. Spinal patients are more susceptible to COVID-19; hence, screening is of vital importance in outpatient and emergency work in spine surgery duringFig. 1. Procedure of spinal outpatient and emergency.
