            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; Figure 1 ) causes acute outbreaks of severe diarrhea and vomiting in all ages of swine, with high morbidity (often 100%) and variable mortality (low in older pigs, but as high as 50 to 100% in young pigs). It is spread via the fecal-oral route, and laboratory testing is the only way to diagnose the virus. Even though PEDV exists in many parts of the world, the first known detection in the United States was reported in May 2013, and it remains unclear how the virus entered the country. As of 1 Nov. 2013, the virus is continuing to spread, with almost 1,000 confirmed PEDV cases in 18 states. The most current information regarding PEDV status in the US can be found at the websites for the National Pork Board (www.pork.org) and the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (www.aasv.org).",

            "text": "Scientists at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Iowa State University (ISU), first detected a transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) viruslike disease in late April of 2013. Initial diagnostic tests were focused on detecting TGE virus and, thus, failed to identify PEDV. However, ISU scientists suspected a TGE-like virus to be involved and submitted fecal samples to the electron microscopy facility at the USDA-ARS National Animal Disease Center where a coronavirus was identified on 10 May 2013. Within the next week, ISU scientists had confirmed a coronavirus with a pan-coronavirus PCR test and notified scientists at the USDA-APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). Working together, ISU and NVSL scientists independently confirmed the virus as PEDV, a member of the porcine coronavirus family that includes TGE virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus in the US. Sequencing the viral genome found it to be > 99% identical to PEDV strains in Asia, where PEDV continues to cause ongoing disease challenges for pork producers (Huang et al., 2013) . Currently, there is no effective treatment for the virus, other than supportive care to combat dehydration, and there are no effective approved vaccines to prevent PEDV-caused disease.",
