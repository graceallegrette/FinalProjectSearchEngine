The absence of vaccine cross-protection and the frequent emergence of new variant strains complicate control of IBV. Here we designed a study to measure the evolution dynamics of IBV strains in China. One hundered and seven complete sequences and 1022 S1-region sequences of Chinese IBVs isolated between 1994 and 2014 were analysed by using MEGA 5.0 software and the Bayesian analysis sampling trees (BEAST) method, and selection pressure on different proteins was assessed. The phylogenetic dissimilarity of different gene trees in the data set indicated possible recombination. Fourteen isolates were identified as recombinants, possibly generated from vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype in recombination with circulating viruses. The earliest IBV in China was found to have existed in the early 1900s, and continues to evolve at a rate of approximately 10 \u00c05 substitutions per site per year. We found that purifying selection was the main evolutionary pressure in the protein-coding regions, while the S1 gene bears the greatest positive selection pressure. The proportion of QX-like genotype strains increased over time.",

They may also give rise to new strains through recombination, and new genotypes may acquire greater virulence as a result of their expedited transmission in vaccinated populations. RNA viruses typically have a high rate of genomic mutation due to their low fidelity of reproduction and low processivity of their RNA polymerase, allowing the viruses to escape host defences and evolve further. The coronavirus has the largest genome of the RNA viruses, comprising nearly 28 kb. As a consequence, it is more likely to mutate under vaccination and environmental pressures (Compton et al., 1993) .",

The sequence comparison of 107 full-length IBV genomes, and phylogenetic and recombination analyses, were then carried out to screen out recombinant strains. We then estimated the evolution rate from a data set of fulllength IBV genome sequences by Bayesian methods. Using the Lognormal relaxed uncorrelated clock method (assuming a constant rate of substitution), we estimated the earliest time of IBV circulation. We also identified the genes that have played a dominant role in IBV evolution by testing the positive selection pressure of different genes.",

            "text": "The current phylogenetic classification of Chinese IBV strains is based on the full or partial nucleotide sequences of their S1, M, E or N genes. To determine whether these genes yielded consistent phylogenetic profiles, we obtained 91 full-length Chinese IBV sequences and 16 reference sequences from GenBank. We then generated nucleotide data sets for each of the four genes and a concatenated sequence of all protein-coding regions. Neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenic trees were reconstructed for all sequence data sets under the Kimura 2-parameter model for each data set (Fig. 1) . The individual and concatenated gene trees revealed several distinct genotypes, including the Mass vaccine-like group, 4/91-like group, QX-like group, Taiwan (TW)-like group, and smaller branches. The strains were not grouped entirely consistently in the different phylogenetic trees and concatenated coding sequences. To investigate the possibility of recombination among the fulllength IBV sequences, we used seven different algorithms implemented in the RDP4 program. We used the strict criterion that recombinant sequences must be identified by more than five methods in the RDP4 program and have statistical support of P 10 \u00c012 (Thor et al., 2011) . The different gene regions of most isolates yielded consistent phylogenic trees, while several taxa changed their genotype affiliation in different gene trees. As shown in Table 1 , the recombination hotspots were mainly concentrated in the genes 1ab, Spike and N, which have been reported to have higher mutation rates and recombination occurrence than other genes of IBV. Fourteen isolates were detected as recombinant strains based on the RDP4 screening criterion and excluded in the subsequent evolution analysis.",

The S1 gene tree was closest to the complete-genome phylogenetic tree. The S1 gene is known to be the main antigenic determinant of IBV (Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003) and is used as the conventional genotyping evidence of IBV (Lee et al., 2003; Wang & Huang, 2000) . However, in several strains the phylogenetic trees of some genes showed a change in their genotype affiliations, suggesting recombination between different circulating IBV strains. Further, 14 sequences showed the possibility of recombination of different genotypes. Among the 14 recombinants we identified, most had a major parent of the QX type, with minor parents of the Mass-41-like, 4/91-like, TW-like or Ark-like genotypes. Our identification of recombinants derived from Mass-41-like vaccine strains confirms that chickens can be simultaneously infected with live virus vaccine and other circulating IBV genotypes (Kottier et al., 1995) . Therefore, incorrect vaccination strategies could inadvertently lead to the mixture of vaccine strains and WT virus. There have been many reports of recombination between other vaccine strains and circulating wild strains, including a PMV-1 (Chong et al., 2010) , bovine viral diarrhea virus (Becher et al., 2001) and infectious bursal disease virus (Hon et al., 2008) , raising concern that modified live virus vaccines, although efficacious, may facilitate the emergence of new strains through recombination with circulating viruses.",

However, in the case of fast-evolving organisms such as RNA viruses, changes in the date of isolation can be used to estimate the time since viruses last shared a common ancestor. Therefore, analyses based on the assumption of a constant rate of molecular evolution, like those used to estimate the date of divergence between sequences, require the date of isolation. More importantly, the differences in isolation dates, under the assumption of rate constancy, provide information about the rate of molecular evolution. That is, the quantity of evolutionary change that has accumulated since the date of isolation (Thorne et al., 1998) . The first outbreaks of IBV in the USA were reported during the 1930s, which is consistent with the results inferred through full-length sequences in this study assuming a strict molecular clock. This method has been used successfully to determine the timing of ancestors of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic strains (Korber et al., 2000) and SARS virus (Zeng et al., 2003) . Our results indicate that the most recent ancestor of IBV existed in the early 1900s, indicating that IBV may have been circulating in nature for a period before its first outbreak. A Bayesian coalescent approach indicated a mean substitution rate of between 2.43\u00c210 -5 and 9.77\u00c210 -5 substitutions per site per year in different genes, which is comparable with the results reported for hepatitis A (Wang et al., 2015) and B (Alvarado Mora et al., 2011) virus and low-virulence Newcastle disease virus (Miller et al., 2009) . The higher substitution rate of the IBV E region may be due to its less important function in virus synthesis and replication than other regions, which may have been subjected to greater immune selection pressure and undergone more substitutions.",

However, there was a clear difference in the selection profiles of different genes. The S1 gene had the highest dN/dS value among the main structural protein-coding genes. The 25 protein-coding sites within the S1 glycoprotein coding region were detectably evolving under positive selection pressure. Frequent point mutations in the hypervariable regions of the spike 1 (S1) gene contributed to most of the antigenic determinants of IBV. The S protein is essential to induce protective immunity, and small differences in the S gene contribute to poor cross-protection. As the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety of coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations. While the IBV N protein has generally been conserved and negatively selected for during viral evolution, we identified three positively selected sites at aa 64S, 300R and 337P in the N protein of IBV, consistent with a previous study (Kuo et al., 2013) .

Among the non-structural protein coding genes, 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b bear greater positive selection pressure than does gene 1 (Nsp2-16). Gene 1 comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome and encodes two overlapping ORFs, 1a and 1b, which are translated as the large polyprotein 1ab. Protein 1ab can be divided into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins and is associated with RNA replication and transcription (Lai & Cavanagh, 1997) . Viral fitness can indeed limit the variability of genes, which is critical to virus replication (S\u00f6derholm et al., 2006) . Thus, it is reasonable that gene 1 undergoes mainly purifying selection in the evolution process of IBV.

Since the QX-like genotype was first reported in China in 1998, it has rapidly increased worldwide and is now the predominant IBV genotype. During the past few years, the QX-like viruses have made up a great proportion of strains identified in many epidemiological investigations worldwide. The poultry industry has, in recent years, detected an increasing incidence of outbreaks of QX-like IBV strains in many countries. Despite the widespread use of live attenuated IBV vaccines (Mass serotype), such as strains H120, H52 and Ma5, vaccinated chicken flocks usually fail to obtain complete protection against challenge with virulent field IBV. Furthermore, we previously found that the virulence of Chinese IBV isolates is increasing (Feng et al., 2012) . The genotype misfit of vaccine and wild viruses results in the sustaining of multiple virulent strains and more complicated situations. Thus, optimal vaccines against circulating IBV strains in China should be attenuated viruses developed against local strains. In conclusion, our results indicate that Chinese IBV isolates are evolving at a rapid rate under the immune selection pressure of vaccines. Therefore, it is possible that the avian immune system has reshaped the IBV genotype and phenotype through positive selection, although genetic mutation and recombination contribute to the natural evolution of IBV. The S1 gene is the first structural gene to be affected by such selection pressure to our knowledge. As the proportion of QX-like isolates becomes larger over time, there will be a greater need for vaccines with new genotypes.",

The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean was used to reconstruct a starting tree. The results were computed and analysed by using the Tracer 1.6 program.

From this inferred linear relation, we can project back to estimate the time of zero branch length. For a standard linear least-squares fit to a line, one implicitly assumes that the data on the independent axis (sampling time) are precisely known, and the best-fit line is chosen to minimize the squared deviation on the dependent axis (branch length).
