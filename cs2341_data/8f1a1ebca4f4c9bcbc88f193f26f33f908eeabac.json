To analyze SARS-CoV-2 (reference Wuhan strain MN908947), we employed CROSS 11 that 96 1) 23 . In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content 103 of spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1) . 104 We used the Vienna method 24 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific 105 regions identified with CROSS 12 . Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS 106 maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.  107   1) . Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating 108 that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity. 109 110 Our analysis suggests presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to interact 111 with specific human proteins 10 . Our observation is based on the assumption that structured regions 112 have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 13 , which is supported by the fact that structured 113 transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 14, 15 . In this analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947 with around 2800 other coronaviruses 123 (data from NCBI) having as host human (Fig. 2) or other species (Supp. Fig. 1) . When comparing 124 SARS-CoV-2 with human coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we 125 found that the most conserved region falls inside the spike S genomic locus (Fig. 2) . More 126 precisely, the conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 and exhibits an intricate 127 and stable secondary structure (RNAfold minimum free energy= -269 kcal/mol ) 24 Sweden, and Australia; data from NCBI and in VIPR www.viprbrc.org). Our analysis aims to 143 determine the relationship between structural content and sequence conservation. 144 145 Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 25 , we observed general conservation of the 146 coding regions with several minima in correspondence to areas between genes (Fig. 3A) . One 147 highly conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 in the spike S genomic locus, 148 while sequences up-and down-stream are variable (Fig. 3A) . We then used CROSSalign 12 to 149 compare the structural content. High variability of structure is observed for both the 5' and 3' and 150",

The list 180 includes canonical and non-canonical RNA-binding proteins, RBPs) 16 . For each fragment, we 181 identified the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z interaction propensity. We 182 used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z greater or equal than 1.50, 1.75 183 and 2 respectively. Importantly, we removed from the list proteins that were predicted to interact 184 promiscuously with different fragments. 185 186 Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5' and is the most contacted by RBPs (around 120 with Z>2 high-187 confidence interactions; Fig. 4A), which is in agreement with the observation that highly structured 188 regions attract a large number of proteins 13 . the 5' contains a leader sequence and the untranslated 189 region with multiple stem loop structures that control RNA replication and transcription 31,32 . 190 191The interactome of each fragment was then analysed using cleverGO, a tool for GO enrichment 192 analysis 33 . Proteins interacting with fragments 1, 2 and 29 were associated with annotations 193 related to viral processes (Fig. 4B; Supp. Table 1).

Finally, for 212 fragment 29, 10 of the 11 viral proteins found are members of the endogenous retrovirus group K 213 Gag polyprotein family, that perform different tasks during virus assembly, budding, maturation 214 (Supp. Table 1). 215 216 Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 36 reveals that proteins interacting 217 with the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2, 218 MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 4B) 37,38 . 219 Interestingly, some of the proteins, including CCNT1, DDX1, ZNF175 for fragment 1 and TRIM32 220 for fragment 2, are reported to be necessary for HIV functions and replications inside the cells. 221 More specifically, in the case of HIV infection, CCNT1 binds to the transactivation domain of the 222 viral nuclear transcriptional activator, Tat, increasing Tat's affinity for the transactivation response 223 RNA element; by doing so, it becomes an essential cofactor for Tat, promoting RNA Pol II 224 activation and allowing transcription of viral genes 39,40 . DDX1 is required for HIV-1 Rev function 225 as well as for HIV-1 and coronavirus IBV replication and it binds to the RRE sequence of HIV-1 226 RNAs 41,42 . ZNF175 is reported to interfere with HIV-1 replication by suppressing Tat-induced viral 227 LTR promoter activity 43 . Finally, TRIM32 is a well-defined Tat binding protein and, more 228 specifically, it binds to the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and can also interact with the HIV-2 and 229 EIAV Tat proteins in vivo 44 . 230 231 Recently, Gordon et al. reported a list of human proteins binding to Open Reading Frames (ORF) 232 translated from SARS-CoV-2 45 .

We 504 found the highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5' (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M 505 protein (nucleotides 26523-27191), and the spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000).
