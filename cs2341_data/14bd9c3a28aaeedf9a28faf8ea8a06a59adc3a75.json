In this paper, we first construct mathematical models of epidemic synchronization, based on traditional dynamical models on complex networks, by applying the adaptive mechanisms observed in real networks. Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results. This work is the first to draw a theoretical bridge between epidemic transmission and synchronization dynamics and will be beneficial to the study of control and the analysis of the epidemics on complex networks.",

Among these different dynamical behaviors, synchronization and epidemic spreading on networks are closely related. For example, with the spread of an infective disease, people may reduce the frequency of inter-personal contact and take collective protective measures with increased regularity (for example, by washing hands frequently with clear water and soap, avoiding going to crowded place, and so on). This means that the spread of information between people during transmission of an epidemic disease can induce spontaneously collective risk-minimisation behaviour in spite of (or at least independently of) the actual disease pathology. Similar phenomena can also be found in many animal-borne infections. Hence, synchronization of individual's behavior and their epidemic behavior on networks can occur simultaneously and interplay adaptively. However, very little theoretical work has been done to consider these two dynamical behaviors together. In this work, we address this deficit. We will investigate mathematically the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the epidemic behavior on complex networks for us to understand them in depth.",

            "text": "It is well known that complex networks can accurately describe the topological structure of many dynamical systems in the real world. For example, the world wide web can be considered as a network of websites with hyperlinks. The Internet is formed by routers with physical connections. Similarly, the human brain can be also regarded as a system of neurons linked by synapses. Many other examples can be also found: the global economy, market, food cycle, metabolism, disease spreading, computer virus, energy diffusion, etc. Recently, research in the area of complex network has advanced significantly and will lead to a deeper study and more practical applications in future. Synchronization dynamics and epidemic dynamics are two of the main research fields in complex network science. In the last ten years, with the important discovery of small-world and scale-free networks, synchronization in complex networks has attracted great attention. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Epidemic transmission in complex networks has also become an important research focus as it offers potential to advance the simple assumptions of homogeneously mixed models. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Since synchronization and epidemic spreading are apparently two quite distinct behaviors, there is very little work to consider them together. Actually, synchronization and epidemic behavior on networks can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. Many realistic epidemic networks have displayed statistically synchronized behavior that we define as the epidemic synchronization which, for the moment, can be classified as epidemic induced synchronization and epidemic characteristic synchronization. For examples, with the spread of SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome), Bird Flu, or H1N1 influenza, people will spontaneously take some protective measures such as washing hands frequently with clear water and soap, avoiding going to crowded place, and so on in order to improve self-protection. 20 When rhinoceroses and hippopotami are infected with epidemic ringworm, they will a) Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. spontaneously go to a lakefront to have a bath in mud which will also provide either cure or protection. As the spread of these epidemic diseases becomes weak, these spontaneous protective behaviors (in either humans or animals) will decrease accordingly. Here, we choose to describe these consistent human or animal behaviors, which result from epidemic spreading, as the epidemic induced synchronization. For another example, weekly measles case reports 21 for Birmingham, Newcastle, Cambridge, and Norwich between 1944 and 1958 have shown their singular oscillatory behavior and an in-phase synchronized pattern between Birmingham and Newcastle, but an anti-phase pattern between Cambridge and Norwich. Similarly, the reported cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea for the Midwest, South, Northeast, and West cities in United States between 1941 and 2002 have also exhibited the oscillatory characteristic and phase synchronized patterns. 22 In addition, collective synchronization induced by epidemic dynamics on complex networks has also been studied numerically. 23 For integrality, we define here these consistent oscillation of measures, which quantify the epidemic degree or other characteristics and do not refer to concrete human or animal behaviors, in epidemic networks as the epidemic characteristic synchronization. In this paper, we just address the epidemic induced synchronization.",

So, it is significant to seek a reliable theory for epidemic synchronization. To this end, in this paper, we first establish the mathematical models to realize the epidemic synchronization and make further analysis of these models to reveal their exhibition mechanisms, based on the theory of dynamical systems. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the traditional models of complex dynamical network and the epidemic network. In Sec. III, the models of SIS (the susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic synchronization and SIR (the susceptible-infected-recovered or the susceptible-infectedremoved) epidemic synchronization are constructed. Then, we investigate the local and global conditions of epidemic synchronization with respect to the epidemic rate of these models. Finally, in Sec. IV, we use some numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results obtained in Sec. III. Section V concludes this paper and lists some possible further works.",

From Fig 1, we can see that I(t) ! 0(t ! 1), i.e., the epidemic does not break out. In this case, the synchronization error e(t) does not converge to zero, which means that the epidemic dynamics cannot successfully induce the synchronization of individuals under small epidemic rate k \u00bc 0.02. From Fig 2, we can see that I(t) converges to a positive number and e(t) converges to zero, which implies that the epidemic dynamics can induce successfully the synchronization of individuals with larger epidemic rate k \u00bc 0.1. Increasing further the epidemic rate to 0.2, we find that the epidemic dynamics can not only induce successfully the synchronization, but also enhance the speed of synchronization. These simulations show that if the epidemic transmission spreads more easily on the network, then the epidemic dynamics can induce the synchronization of individuals more effectively. This is consistent with the attained theoretic results in Sec. III-an aggressive disease leads to a strong response from individuals.",
