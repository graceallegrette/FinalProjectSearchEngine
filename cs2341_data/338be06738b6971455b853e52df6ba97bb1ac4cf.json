China has made remarkable achievements in the development of supercomputers, under the support of the Chinese government, to which the Tianhe series of supercomputers have recently made significant contributions. Milky Way-1 was designed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in 1983; its appearance made China the third country to design such supercomputers. In 1994, Dawning-1 was developed by the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which accelerated the independent development of Chinese supercomputers. In November 2015, Tianhe-2, developed by the NUDT, has retained its position as the world's fastest supercomputer at the International Supercomputing Conference in Austin, America.

With the rapid development of molecular and structural biology, the 3D structures and functions of biological macromolecules have been determined. Meanwhile, the application of computational methods to drug discovery and molecular simulation has increased together with the rapid advancement of computer science, powerful functions of graphic workstations, and high-performance computers. Quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics (MD), and combinations of these methods have been widely used in drug development. Traditionally, marketing a new drug in the pharmaceutical industry is a difficult process that often costs more than one billion US dollars and takes approximately 10 years. A series of CDDD approaches based on the 3D structures of biological macromolecules (e.g. proteins and nucleic acids), such as the highthroughput virtual screening method, have greatly improved the efficiency of drug discovery. According to a United States government report, because of the application of CDDD, drug development costs are reduced by around 130 million US dollars and research time is shortened by a year [3] .",

In addition, more than 90 universities and research institutions all over the country have established departments for computational drug discovery. The Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM) at CAS has developed and compiled a series of drug design algorithms and programs, some of which possess thousands of registered users that are currently implanted on supercomputers and are widely used worldwide. For example, the molecular docking software GroupDock, developed by SIMM, has completed parallelization on domestic supercomputers, which has reached hundreds of thousands of CPU cores, allowing virtual screening of large-scale databases in a short time. Besides, the development of GroupDock is based on the UCSF Dock. It mainly deals with the massive docking tasks and optimization of parallelization on China-made HPC systems such as Shenwei. It otherwise performs nearly the same as UCSF DOCK. The software has become a drug research and development platform based on NHPCE, which promotes innovational drug discovery and development.

During the implementation of China's 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans, biomedical information and diverse key technology platforms were preliminarily constructed and perfected. These platforms included drug design and screening, preclinical pharmacodynamics of novel drugs, and pharmacokinetics and drug safety evaluations. In addition, computational genomics, computational proteomics, computational regulation networks, and computational drug design are playing an increasing number of important roles in the preclinical stages of the drug development pipeline. Most such computation is computationally intensive and requires the support of HPC supercomputers. By applying HPC, these technology platforms are able to produce biomedical big data that include massive amounts of pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenomic information with increasing speed. Understanding how to better utilize these data (e.g. huge amounts of public information including patents) and improving our understanding of the complex biological processes underlying drug action and the efficiency of drug discovery are important issues to address for the future of drug development. Currently, simulation and 3D structure prediction of protein folding, as well as active compound discovery against targets from current compound libraries, have become important directions for drug discovery. The simulation accuracy and enrichment rate of virtual drug screening, to a large extent, depend on computational performance. A supercomputer on the exascale is required for a microsecond simulation of a system containing millions of atoms. Innovative drug-related computational genomics, proteomics, network interaction, and drug design technologies demand mass HPC resources. These critical technologies rely on the development of the next generation of exascale high-performance computers. It is exascale computing that will be in urgent demand for personalized drug development in the next 5-10 years.",

Usually, molecular docking takes a few seconds to minutes on modern CPUs considering only the flexibility of small molecules and keeping the protein rigid. Thus, virtual screening against a target consumes a great amount of computational resources that only supercomputers can provide. Next, thousands of compounds with the best docking scores are kept for structural clustering. Within the clustered compound list, about 100 candidate compounds are finally selected for subsequent validation. The criteria for manual selection are drug-like properties and binding modes generated by molecular docking. To validate the potency of these candidate compounds, various methods are employed, including enzymatic activity assays, enzymatic binding assays, enzymatic selectivity assays, structureactivity relationship studies, and cell assays. Recent REVIEW successful applications of virtual screening in our lab are briefly introduced below.",

On the two external test sets compiled from DrugBank and In order to further verify the effectiveness of the approach on practical cases, target prediction was made for nine drugs withdrawn from the market because of hERG toxicity [27] using the 3NN fusion scheme.

A total of 12 neuraminidase inhibitors of avian influenza were discovered with enzyme activity similar to that of zanamivir and effective in vivo. These 12 inhibitors possess independent intellectual property rights, 2 of which have satisfactory activity. Several further lead compounds with innovative structures, independent intellectual property rights, and activities similar to zanamivir (which can act against the virus at a viral level) have been acquired.

However, in the simulation of the KCNQ2 channel, another member of Kv channels and an anti-epilepsy target, a cavity filled with water molecules appeared in the VSD (Fig. 4B) . As the volume of this space is \u223c170\u00c5 3 , we guessed that a potential-binding pocket was located in the KCNQ2 VSD. Based on the docking model of ztz240 (a KCNQ2 activator reported previously [59] ) to the KCNQ2 homology model, one MD simulation on the ztz240/KCNQ2 complex was conducted by using GROMACS 4.5.4 package [50] , which provided a structural binding model for ztz240. Further mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies validated this activator-binding pocket in the VSD of KCNQ2 [60] (Fig. 4B) . Subsequent structure-based virtual screening targeting the identified pocket discovered nine activators with five new chemotypes, two of which exhibited significant anti-epilepsy activity [60] (Fig. 4B) . These results demonstrate the capability of the KCNQ2 VSD to accommodate small chemical ligands.

            "text": "As an example, we will first show its successful application to predict interactions of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) with the KCNQ2 channel. PIP 2 is a phospholipid component that is enriched at the plasma membrane, and a substrate for a number of important signalling proteins including the Kv channels [61] [62] [63] [64] . Though PIP 2 alters the physiological function and pharmacological selectivity of KCNQ channels [65] [66] [67] , the effects and interactions of PIP 2 on KCNQ channels are not well understood. To predict the interactions of PIP 2 with the KCNQ2 channel, 200 ns allatom MD simulations on both the open and closed conformations of the KCNQ2 channel were performed using GROMACS 4.6.1 package [50, 68] . Liu et al. 57 Simulations with two different force fields yielded similar PIP 2 interactions: PIP 2 preferentially interacted with K230 in the S4-S5 linker of the openstate KCNQ2 channel, whereas it contacted K160 and other positive residues in the S2-S3 loop of the closed state (Fig. 4C) . These interactions were different from the PIP 2 -Shaker and PIP 2 -Kv1.2 interactions [69] . Consistently, the effects of PIP 2 on KCNQ2 were also different relative to the Shaker and Kv1.2 channels. The results indicate the diversity of PIP 2 effects on Kv channels. The mechanism we proposed for the action of PIP 2 on the KCNQ2 channel is consistent with the reported subtype sensitivity of PIP 2 to Kv channels [70, 71] and indicates that PIP 2 may exert specific effects on KCNQ1 channels [68] . Thus, MD simulation is an effective method with which to analyse protein-lipid interaction. MD simulation has also been successfully applied to identify cholesterol binding for a variety of GPCRs [72] [73] [74] [75] . Of interest are the two major \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtypes \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR, which share 76% sequence identity and are highly similar in structure but have distinct and sometimes opposing effects in both cardiovascular physiology and the pathogenesis of heart failure [76, 77] . Because \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR are subtypes specifically compartmentalized on cholesterolenriched caveolae or lipid rafts, two 8 \u03bcs MD simulations of \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR embedded in a 2:1 1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol mixture membrane were performed using the GRO-MACS 4.5.3 package [50] to compare the potential cholesterol-binding sites for \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR. Big differences were observed in the cholesterol interaction sites between \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR, which are relevant to cholesterol-mediated dimerisation and the allosteric regulation of receptor activity [78] . Our MD simulations provide valuable clues regarding cholesterol binding to \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR and shed light on general determinants of cholesterol binding to GPCRs.",

MD simulation has emerged as a practical approach for exploring protein dynamics but is still unequal as a generally applicable strategy to explore large-scale protein conformational transitions. Considering the structure of the new generation supercomputer, we developed a new approach, called NUMD, to deal with largescale protein conformational movement, which is a combination of normal mode analysis and umbrella sampling MD simulation. This new approach can produce thousands of the protein conformations along the conformational transition pathway, and each conformation can be simulated simultaneously with thousands of CPUs. Therefore, compared with other widely used MD approaches including NAMD, GROMACS, and AMBER, the new code is specifically suitable for HPC to delineate atomically detailed conformational transition pathways and the associated free energy landscapes. Its application on three well-known protein systems (adenylate kinase (AdK), calmodulin (CaM), and p38\u03b1 kinase) in the absence and presence of their respective ligands revealed that the predicted conformational transition pathway and thermodynamic observables were in good agreement with experimentally and computationally determined ones (Fig. 5) . Thus, this simple approach offers a generally applicable strategy by using HPC for probe intrinsic or ligand-induced largescale protein conformational transitions and the associated free energy landscape [79, 80] .",

Two pathologically characterized hallmarks of AD are the appearance of extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [81, 82] . The major constituents of the plaques are amyloid \u03b2-peptides (A\u03b2) of 39-43 amino acids, which are produced by the sequential action of \u03b2and \u03b3 -secretases on the amyloid precursor protein [83] . A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 are the two most abundant A\u03b2 isoforms, with the only difference found at their C-termini, where the latter has two more hydrophobic residues. It has been demonstrated that A\u03b242 is more neurotoxic than A\u03b240, and that an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 concentration ratio correlates with the onset of AD [84, 85] .",

This implies that the peptides are able to adopt a diverse set of conformations in which the anti-parallel or parallel \u03b2-sheet is often the key structural element. There is a dire need for structural studies of A\u03b2 monomers and aggregates at the atomic level, to answer crucial questions such as when and how the \u03b2-sheet structure is formed and why A\u03b242 aggregates more rapidly and severely than A\u03b240. In view of the high propensity for self-assembly, MD simulations, complementary to the standard tools of structural biology such as NMR and X-ray diffraction, appear to be a useful tool with which to obtain atomic level insights into the structures as well as the conformational changes of A\u03b2, a prerequisite to the development of more specific drugs with optimal affinities for A\u03b2 monomers or toxic oligomers.",

In aqueous solution, an \u03b1helix to \u03b2-sheet conformational transition of A\u03b240 was observed and a completed unfolding process of the peptide from helix to coil was traced by our MD simulations. Structures with few short \u03b2-sheets and helices were identified as intermediate states in the unfolding pathway of A\u03b240 (Fig. 6) . Four tandem glycines (G25, G29, G33, and G37) at the Cterminal of A\u03b240 were found to account for the short \u03b2-sheet formation. Further mutation of these glycines to alanines almost abolished the \u03b2-sheet formation and increased the content of the helix component instead (Fig. 6) . In the lipid bilayer of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, the major secondary structure of A\u03b240 is helical; however, the peptide tends to exit from the hydrophobic region and lie down on the surface of the bilayer. Overall, these results provide an annotation of conformational transition in relation to the dynamic process of A\u03b2 exiting from the membrane and entering into aqueous solution. It is beneficial to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of A\u03b2 aggregation and design compounds that can inhibit the formation of oligomers as well as amyloid fibrils (Fig. 6) .",

Chemical compounds that lock the structure of A\u03b2 into the \u03b1helix/\u03b2-sheet intermediate state could possibly inhibit A\u03b2 fibrillation. Targeting this intermediate structure, a virtual screening based on molecular docking was performed with the goal of discovering small molecule inhibitors that interrupt the formation of the pleated \u03b2-sheet structures involved in amyloid fibrils via binding to the intermediate structure [91] . One of the docked compounds, DC-AB1, was shown to effectively inhibit the aggregation and fibrillation of A\u03b2 by thioflavin T fluorescence assay, atomic force microscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Meanwhile, CD spectroscopy measurement revealed that the \u03b2sheet component of A\u03b2 increased in the presence of DC-AB1, suggesting that the binding of DC-AB1 to A\u03b2 stabilized the \u03b2-sheet structure of the peptide. Taken together, our study not only demonstrated that the \u03b1-helix/\u03b2-sheet intermediate structures revealed by the aforementioned simulations could be used as a binding target for inhibitor design, but also provided new insights into the molecular events involved in the conformational transition of A\u03b2 peptides in fibrillogenesis.",

In a recent study, we set out to investigate the conformation dynamics of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 by exploring the impact of intramolecular interactions on conformation dynamics using equilibrium MD simulations [93] . Our 40 \u03bcs-scale simulations revealed heterogeneous conformation ensembles of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 that encompassed \u223c35% \u03b2-strand and \u223c60% unstructured coils. Two conformational states were identified in both isoforms: a collapsed state (CS) that resembles the structural motif of face-to-face hydrophobic clustering in amyloid fibrils, and an extended state (ES) that carries the structural feature of anti-parallel \u03b2sheets observed in amyloid oligomers. This observation is in line with previous NMR studies. In A\u03b240, the C-terminus remains unstructured and rarely interacts with other parts, therefore, the hydrophobic clustering is loosely structured and the peptide assumes an ES with high probability. In contrast, the C-terminus of A\u03b242 adopts a \u03b2-strand structure that strongly interacts with segments E3-R5 and V18-A21. The active associations of this extra \u03b2-strand lead to a more compact hydrophobic collapse and prevent the isoform from forming the ES. Based on our structural characterization, we propose that the aggregation begins in the CS, and that the propensity of the various isoforms to self-associate into a particular form is encoded in their equilibrium conformational states. As our simulation results demonstrate that the probability of A\u03b242 staying in CS is significantly higher than that of A\u03b240, the enhanced aggregation propensity of the former could result from the consequent lowered energy barrier for nucleate formation. Besides, a greater resemblance to fibril structure is observed in the CS of A\u03b242, including increased occupancy of the \u03b2-strand at V18-A21 and I31-M35 and compact hydrophobic collapse. These structural advantages could also contribute to the effectiveness of nucleation.",
