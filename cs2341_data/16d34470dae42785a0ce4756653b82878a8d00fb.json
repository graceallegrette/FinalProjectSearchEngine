The objective of this study is to create a practical instrument for use in predicting an individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients. Methods: A matched case-control study (1:2 ratios) was performed in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2019. We reviewed specific factors and outcomes regarding patients with H7N9 virus infection (VI) to determine relationships and developed a nomogram to calculate individualized survival probability. This tool was used to predict each individual patient's probability of survival based on results obtained from the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: We examined 227 patients with H7N9 VI enrolled in our study. Stepwise selection was applied to the data, which resulted in a final model with 8 independent predictors [including initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2264300 mmHg, age \u226560 years, chronic diseases, poor hand hygiene, time from illness onset to the first medical visit, incubation period \u22645 days, peak C-reactive protein \u2265120 mg/L], and initial bilateral lung infection. The concordance index of this nomogram was 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.694-0.901] and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.611-0.952) for the training and validation sets, respectively, which indicates adequate discriminatory power. The calibration curves for the survival showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation in the training and validation sets, respectively. Conclusion: We established and validated a novel nomogram that can accurately predict the survival probability of patients with H7N9 VI. This nomogram can serve an important role in counseling patients with H7N9 VI and guide treatment decisions.",

However, available data that address this point are limited. It has been previously shown that clinicians who make diagnostic and treatment decisions based solely on their clinical judgment lack predictive accuracy regarding death risk in human H7N9 infection cases and are, therefore, unable to increase the survival probability in these cases. [5] [6] [7] An accurate assessment of survival probability would help tailor treatment in human H7N9 infection cases. Unfortunately, the vast majority of published studies 8, 9 on the topic focus on risk factors of H7N9 infection and case fatalities.",

To date, almost all of these studies have identified multiple risk factors but did not integrate them so as to comprehensively assess a patient's specific survival probability in human H7N9 VI. It is now well established from a variety of studies that the nomogram model is an algorithm with integrating predictors and has been identified as a practical tool of preventive interventions. 10 In addition, a nomogram can accurately predict and estimate the individualized risk of a disease and quantitatively demonstrate a personalized probability for predicting the incidence of disease outcome. 11 To better evaluate the predictors associated with survival outcomes, based on a matched case\u2212control study (1:2 ratios), we retrospectively investigated the sociodemographic, clinical and epidemiological data of 227 laboratoryconfirmed cases of H7N9 VI in Zhejiang province, China, between March 1, 2013, and May 31, 2019.

Based on the results of the present study, we established and validated a robust nomogram for providing simple and precise personalized prediction of the survival of H7N9 cases (Figure 2 ). Our findings may provide more reliable evidence in developing prevention and control strategies of H7N9 VI. We anticipate that these results will be useful in reducing the mortality of H7N9 VI and the design of clinical interventions for improving the life quality of patients with H7N9 VI.",

First, this is the first nomogram for predicting the survival of H7N9 patients that has collected enough risk factors to allow reliable prediction and evaluation analyses. Second, in the validation analysis of nomogram, whether internal (i.e., the C-index of this nomogram was 0.802 and 0.793 for the training and validation sets, respectively) or external, the comprehensive model produced both sufficient precision and satisfied uniformity in predicting the survival of H7N9 VI.

The clinic nomogram may demonstrate better individualized identification than a general regressive forecasting model. 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] Although previous reports 7 have suggested that a logistic regression model is used to evaluate the death risk of H7N9 VI, it may not accurately reflect the effect of variables on prognostication.

            "text": "Interestingly, it could be inferred that a significant association exists between a shorter incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases. Generally, when the incubation period or the duration of premonitory symptoms are shorter in respiratory diseases, the symptoms are more severe and the mortality rate is higher, 21, 22 this rule of thumb is supported by the present study's findings. This association may be attributed to the avian influenza virus' growth characteristics, receptor usage, and host response leading to more severe cytopathic effects. 23 Likewise, PHH is significantly associated with the survival in patients with H7N9 VI. Research has indicated that a high viral load is associated with illness severity and prognosis, 24 which might have originated from poor hand hygiene and self-protection measures after contact with poultry or other animals. 13, 25 To improve the survival of H7N9 VI, it is vital that appropriate hand hygiene practices are implemented by the susceptible population after direct contact with poultry or birds. Furthermore, it can be inferred that PHH is associated with a nonlinear effect on the survival of H7N9 patients ( Figure 2 ). Although worse survival among H7N9 patients with PHH has been previously noted, 25 our study better defines the nonlinear relation of PHH to outcome. Most notably, IPFR is a used clinical predictor of H7N9 VI's outcome in the present study, though its diagnostic utility is disputed in clinical work. 26 In accordance with the present result, previous studies 27, 28 have demonstrated that PFR is a very essential indicator to assess the acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome of a patient. As known, the oxygen transport is diffusion-limited from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary in patients with pulmonary diseases (i.e., pulmonary fibrosis). 29 Several reports [26] [27] [28] [29] have shown that the PFR responds to an increase of diversion at a constant oxygen saturation by indicating poorer pulmonary function. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the PFR may be used in clinical settings as an indicator of predicting pulmonary function status of patients with H7N9 VI. In the model presented here, the survival of H7N9 VI is associated with IPFR less than or equal to 300 mmHg (see Table 4 ). This finding, while preliminary, suggests that IPFR would seem an adequate measure of pulmonary dysfunction in patients with H7N9 VI.",

Our study confirms that decreased IPFR is defined as a strong predictor of survival of patients with H7N9 VI. An implication of this is the possibility that the uppermost treatment strategy is to improve pulmonary function for H7N9 cases. We also find that the peak CRP level may be considered a particularly important factor when evaluating the probability associated with survival in H7N9 cases. According to a study conducted by Gao and colleagues, 31 CRP is involved in the deterioration observed in severe influenza infection and may be a candidate molecule for immunotherapy treatment. A previous study 31 indicated that CRP treatment can improve the prognosis of patients with H7N9 VI. It is well known that therapeutic measures are elective, so we should select a treatment measure that can improve CRP. This clinic tool may be able to help physicians to solve such problems. Moreover, this nomogram can provide information in guiding clinicians' decision-making regarding the most effective intervention strategies for H7N9 patients. For example, according to this algorithm, an H7N9 patient is found to be a high risk for death. This finding has an important implication for developing the strategy of early intervention in the high-risk death population of H7N9 patients. In addition, we find that the cost of applying this nomogram is mainly involved in developing a practice tool of nomogram (i.e., an evaluation scale) and incorporating the nomogram into the treatment information system of hospital. To the government department, it should be able to afford the cost and expense of applying this tool. Overall, this nomogram may display the advanced public health concept of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. 32 This tool deserves to be further explored in future researches of clinic and public health. Considering these advantages of nomogram, we suggest that the government should guide, support and foster the development of this tool. Additionally, a treatment scheme of H7N9 cases including this nomogram should be formulated by the government. Our study does have some limitations. First, our nomogram is limited by the retrospective nature of the data, which could suffer from recall bias and failure to incorporate some recognized prognostic parameters (e.g., the frequency or intensity of exposure and bacterial coinfection) and some important molecular factors (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokine and angiotensin II). Second, further efforts regarding prospective data collection and patient follow-up, wider geographic recruitment, and the incorporation of additional factors are encouraged to improve this tool. Third, further studies with large sample populations are necessary to confirm our model. Despite these limitations, as we know, there are limited numbers of published data on the survival of H7N9 patients. Therefore, this study could contribute information about the novel concept of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for the survival of H7N9 patients.",
