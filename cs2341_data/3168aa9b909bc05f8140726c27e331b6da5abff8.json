The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability for de novo sequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets.",

The two most striking attributes of this technology, the large read depth and short sequence length, make it suitable for re-sequencing applications where a known reference sequence is used as a template for alignment. However, the ability to decode novel sequencing targets, such as unsequenced genomes or metagenomic libraries is limited. Twenty-five mers are far more ubiquitous than Sanger-size reads (500-1000 bp) in any given genome. Since the sequence complexity increases by a factor 4 for every base added, the likelihood of observing redundant sequences increases dramatically with decreased read length for sequences shorter than 20 bp. The read length needed to achieve maximal uniqueness varies depending on the genome being sequenced, its size and repeat content (Whiteford et al., 2005) . Although some studies have explored the feasibility of de novo genome assembly using 70-80 bp reads (Chaisson et al., 2004) , none describe tools for de novo assembly of shorter sequences.",

            "text": "DNA sequences in a single multi fasta file are read in memory, populating a hash table keyed by unique sequence reads with values representing the number of occurrences of that sequence in the set. A prefix tree is used to organize the sequences and their reverse-complemented counterparts by their first eleven 5 0 end bases. The sequence reads are sorted by decreasing number of occurrences to reflect coverage and minimize extension of reads containing sequencing errors. Each unassembled read, u, is used in turn to nucleate an assembly. Each possible 3 0 most k-mer is generated from u and is used for the search until the word length is smaller than a user-defined minimum, m, or until the k-mer has a perfect match with the 5 0 end bases of read r. In that latter case, u is extended by the unmatched 3 0 end bases contained in r, and r is removed from the hash table and prefix tree. The process of cycling through progressively shorter 3 0 -most k-mers is repeated after every extension of u. Since only left-most searches are possible with a prefix tree, when all possibilities have been exhausted for the 3 0 extension, the complementary strand of the contiguous sequence generated (contig) is used to extend the contig on the 5 0 end. The DNA prefix tree is used to limit the search space by efficiently binning the sequence reads. There are two ways to control the stringency in SSAKE. The first is to stop the extension \u00c3 To whom correspondence should be addressed. when a k-mer matches the 5 0 end of more than one sequence read (\u00c0s 1). This leads to shorter contigs, but minimizes sequence misassemblies. The second is to stop the extension when a k-mer is smaller than a user-set minimum word length (m). SSAKE outputs a log file with run information along with two multi fasta files, one containing all sequence contigs constructed and the other containing the unassembled sequence reads.",

For larger and more complex sequencing targets, such as bacterial genomes, short reads can be rapidly and stringently assembled into contigs that accurately represent the non-repetitive portion of the genome. It is clear that the best approach for de novo sequencing of targets more complex than viral genomes will likely involve some combination of Sanger reads and assembled short reads. For metagenomics, our simulation involving 40 M short reads from the Sargasso Sea WGS data indicate that these types of reads can be used to produce conservative contigs in a robust and tractable manner, while minimizing probabilistic errors.

N50 length is length that marks 50% genome content.",
