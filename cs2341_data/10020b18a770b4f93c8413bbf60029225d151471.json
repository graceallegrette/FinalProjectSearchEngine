Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In the study by Wang et al [6] , chloroquine was shown to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 value of 1.13 \u03bcM after a 48 hour incubation time. These findings are comparable with our in vitro chloroquine results of an EC50 value of 5.47 \u03bcM. In addition, an unpublished clinical trial has demonstrated the therapeutic effect of chloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. On the basis of hydroxychloroquine's superior antiviral and prophylactic activity, as well as its more tolerable safety profile in comparison to chloroquine, we believe that hydroxychloroquine may be a promising drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] .",

This may progress to a cytokine storm, followed by multi-organ failure and potentially death. Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can 16 / 25 suppress the increase of immune factors [29, 30] . Bearing this in mind, it is possible that early treatment with either of the drugs may help prevent the progression of the disease to a critical, life-threatening state. In critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients the use of corticosteroids may be harmful [31] . Whilst, the use of immunosuppressants (e.g. tocilizumab) are not ideal either as it can suppress the immune system and lead to an increased risk of infection [32] . In this setting, hydroxychloroquine may be an ideal drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection as it can inhibit the virus via its antiviral effects and help mediate the cytokine storm via its immunomodulatory effects. Based on work conducted in our lab, we recommend the concomitant use of low dose hydroxychloroquine with an anti-inflammatory drug to help mitigate the cytokine storm in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients.",
