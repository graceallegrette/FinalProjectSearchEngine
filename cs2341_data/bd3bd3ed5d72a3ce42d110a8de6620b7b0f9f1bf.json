To find out the location of corona virus mutations of one type to another, DNA sequences can be aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Corona virus data was taken from Genbank National Center for Biotechnology Information from 1985-1992. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a global alignment algorithm in which alignment is performed to all sequences with the complexity of O (mn) and is capable of producing optimal alignment. An important step in this reserach is the sequence alignment of two corona viruses using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Second, identification of the location of mutations from the DNA of the virus. The result of this reserach is an alignment and the location of mutations of both sequences. The results of identification DNA mutation can be used to find out other viruses mutation corona virus as well as can be used in the field of health as a reference for the manufacture of drugs for corona virus mutation outcome.",

Dynamic programming in DNA sequence alignment has two types of techniques, namely global and local alignment. Some algorithms used in local alignment include Smith-Waterman, FASTA, BLAST, and many algorithms that are being developed. As for global alignment, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is still often used and also developed to be more efficient [3] .",

This shows that the corona virus DNA in the type of infectious bronchitis virus in 1985 and 1992 has und ergone a mutation. 2. The homology level uses 7 variations of match values, different mismatches and gaps produce almo st the same homology level (difference below 1), this shows that the determination of match values, mismatch and gap does not affect the level of homology. 3. Based on Figure 4 , 7 out of 10 experiments (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th trials) gave the max imum score at score 6, the score with match = 14, mismatch = -8 and gap = 8. 7 variations of match values, different mismatches and gaps produce different maximum scores. This shows that determin ing the match value, mismatch and gap affect the maximum score. 4. Based on Figure 5 , variations in match values, mismatches and gaps 2, 4, 5, and 6 produce the same mutations. However, in variations in match values, mismatches and gaps 1, 3 and 7 produce differen t mutations. This shows that the determination of match values, mismatch and gap affects mutations . ",
