IL-6 levels diverge profoundly between non-survivors and survivors in the third week after symptom onset and are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality 1, 8, 9 . Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19-CSS (ChiCTR2000029765, NCT04306705, NCT04310228) [10] [11] [12] . Pending data from randomized controlled trials, retrospective data from 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab suggests that inhibition of the IL-6 signaling axis is highly effective 13 . However, given the cost, immunosuppression, and potential adverse reactions of tocilizumab, this strategy will likely be restricted to select patients in developed countries.",

The findings discussed herein offer a rationale for studying \u237a1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of COVID-19-CSS. However, all drugs can have unanticipated side effects, and the incompletely understood relationship between hypertension and COVID-19 suggests caution in using any agent that impacts blood pressure 15 . Prospective, double-blinded clinical trials of \u237a1-AR antagonists in high-risk patients, when administered prior to symptom onset, will therefore be required to assess their utility in preventing COVID-19-CSS.

            "text": ", no controlled trials have examined the benefits of \u237a1-AR antagonism for the prevention of CSS and ARDS in human subjects. To investigate a potential role for \u237a1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 12,673 men (age 45-64) with \"ARDS\" as identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9and ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Of these, 1,189 patients (9.4%) were prescribed \u237a1-AR antagonists in the previous year, 8.1% died in the hospital, and 15.6% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and confidence intervals (CI) correlating receipt of \u237a1-AR antagonists (doxazosin, prazosin, silodosin, terazosin, and tamsulosin) in the previous year with these outcomes. Models were adjusted for comorbid conditions in the prior year as well as age and year of hospital admission.We found that patients with prior use of \u237a1-AR antagonists had lower adjusted odds of the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to non-users (AOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, p=0.008)(Figure 1). The unadjusted association was similar in magnitude (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.94, p=0.007), as were results analyzing each component endpoint separately. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these findings support a clinical rationale to study \u237a1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of ARDS and states of local and systemic immune dysregulation. Given the limitations of claims databases and retrospective analyses, our data on their own cannot establish causality or a therapeutic benefit of \u237a1-AR antagonists.",
