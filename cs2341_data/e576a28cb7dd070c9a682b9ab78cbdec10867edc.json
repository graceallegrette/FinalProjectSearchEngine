It has been declared a 3 pandemic by the World Health Organization in 11 March 2020 (1). Although 4 massive intervention measures have been implemented in China (e.g. shutting 5 down cities, extending holidays and travel ban) and many other countries, the 6 spread of the disease are unlikely to be stopped over the world shortly. It is 7 becoming evident that environmental factors are associated with seasonality of 8 respiratory-borne diseases' epidemics (2). Previous studies have suggested that 9 ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) exposure may play a role in the phenotypes of 1 0 respiratory diseases, including, but not limited to, influenza, asthma and severe 1 1 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). NO 2 ), for example, might increase the 1 2 susceptibility of adults to virus infections (3). High exposure to NO 2 before the 1 3 start of a respiratory viral infection is associated with the severity of asthma 1 4 exacerbation (4). This study aims to assess the associations of ambient NO 2 1 5 levels with spread ability of COVID-19 across 63 Chinese cities, and provides We collected COVID-19 confirmed case information reported by the 2 0 .

The R 0 means the expected number of 4 secondary cases produced by an initial infectious individual, in a completely 5 susceptible population. The calculation process is completed by R software. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the spatial associations 1 5 of NO 2 with R 0 of COVID-19, and a longitudinal analysis to examine the temporal associations (day-by-day) of NO 2 with R 0 in the cities in Hubei 1 7 province since they had enough confirmed case number to acquire stable daily Hubei. We used multiple linear regression to assess the relationship between the 2 0 spread ability of COVID-19 and NO 2 pollution across the different cities. The cross-sectional analysis shows that, after adjustment for temperature 6 and humidity, the R 0 was positively associated with NO 2 in all cities (\u03c7 2 =10.18, 7 p=0.037). In a following stratified analysis, a significant association was 8 confirmed in the cities outside of Hubei (r=0.29, p=0.046), while it is not the 9 case in the cities inside Hubei (r=0.51, p=0.130) (Figure 1) . We did not find In temporal scale, we calculated daily R 0 of 11 cities in Hubei except Wuhan these cities afterwards), and normalized them based on Wuhan's daily R 0 in 1 5 order to avoid other covariates' effects. We found that the 11 Hubei cities Our study has limitations. Given the ecological nature of study, other city- 1 5 level factors, such as implementation ability of COVID-19 control policy, develop individual based models with high spatial-temporal resolution to assess 1 9 the correlation between air pollution and epidemiologic characteristics of 2 0 .

To our knowledge, this is the first 4 study to investigate the ambient air pollution associated with the transmission of 5 COVID-19. Our results reported the significant association between NO 2 6 exposure and R 0 , suggesting that ambient NO 2 may contribute to the spread 7 ability of COVID-19. Previous studies have suggested that the increase spread 8 ability from NO 2 might not be caused by increased susceptibility of the 9 epithelial cells to infection but may result from effects of NO 2 on host defenses 1 0that prevent the spread of virus(5). Since NO 2 is a traffic-related air pollutant,1  1    the association may also be explained by the relationship between virus spread 1 2 and population movement.
