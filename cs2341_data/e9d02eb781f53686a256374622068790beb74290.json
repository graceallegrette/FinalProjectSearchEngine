The number of screening tests carried out and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). We develop a 'mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR ODE model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The objective of this model is not to make forecasts but to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation window in France and to deduce the IFR associated with the epidemic in France. Main results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor \u00d75 (95%-CI: 3.5-7.8) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3 \u2212 0.8). Although accurate in France, the SIR model cannot capture the decline in the number of cases observed in South Korea: this points out the strong impact on the epidemic dynamics of the management strategy adopted in South Korea.",

(2020) , the median period of viral shedding is 20 days, but the infectiousness tends to decay before the end of this period: the results in He et al.

The data used here contain a limited amount of information, especially since the observation period considered is short and corresponds to the initial phase of the epidemic dynamics, which can be strongly influenced by discrete events. This limit led us to use a particularly parsimonious model in order to avoid problems of identifiability for the parameters. The assumptions underlying the model are therefore relatively simple and the results must be interpreted with regard to these assumptions. For instance, the date of the introduction t 0 must be seen as an efficient date of introduction for a dynamics where a single introduction would be decisive for the outbreak and the other (anterior and posterior) introductions would have an insignificant effect on the dynamics.
