Angus and Simmental \u00d7 Angus steers (n = 136; body weight [BW] = 200 \u00b1 26 kg) were utilized in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design. Calves were blocked by source, and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) two-stage weaning and ITM (2MM), 2) two-stage weaning and saline injection (2SAL), 3) abrupt weaning and ITM (AbtMM), or 4) abrupt weaning and saline injection (AbtSAL). On d\u22126, calves were weighed, plastic calf weaner devices (used to prevent calf from nursing) were inserted in two-stage weaned calves, and ITM or saline injections (1 mL/45.4 kg BW) were administered. On day 0, plastic calf weaner devices were removed, and calves were weighed and shipped 272 km to Urbana, IL. Steer behavior was observed the 2 d following separation from dam. Receiving period was day 0 to 42 and growing period was day 42 to 124. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS and pen (six per treatment) was the experimental unit. Abruptly weaned calves had greater (P < 0.01) preweaning average daily gain (ADG) than twostage weaned calves. Treatment did not affect (P \u2265 0.16) ADG during the receiving or growing period; however, calves that received ITM tended (P 0.06) to have greater ADG from day 0 to 124. During the receiving period, abruptly weaned calves tended (P = 0.08) to eat more than two-stage calves and ITM calves ate more (P = 0.03) than calves that received saline. There was a weaning strategy \u00d7 ITM interaction (P < 0.01) for dry matter intake (DMI) from day 0 to 124; 2MM calves ate more (P < 0.01) than 2SAL, but DMI was not different (P = 0.58) between AbtMM and AbtSAL calves. There was a weaning strategy \u00d7 ITM interaction (P < 0.01) for gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) from day 0 to 124; 2SAL calves had greater (P = 0.05) G:F than AbtSAL, with 2MM and AbtMM calves being intermediate and not different (P = 0.38) than each other. Twostage weaning decreased (P \u2264 0.02) the percentage of calves walking, standing, and vocalizing, and increased (P \u2264 0.02) the percentage of calves lying and eating following separation from dam. Twostage weaning decreased preweaning ADG and behavioral signs of stress at feedlot arrival, but had no effect on overall growth. In addition, ITM had no effect on calf BW or behavior, but increased overall DMI in two-stage weaned calves compared to abruptly weaned calves and tended to increase overall ADG regardless of weaning strategy.",

            "text": "Most beef operations wean by abruptly separating the cow and calf, usually at a much younger age than in a natural or self-weaning situation (Hudson et al., 2010) . The results of abrupt weaning are well documented and consistent, as cows and calves spend more time walking and vocalizing and less time resting or eating (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1989) . Excessive vocalizations can increase the respiratory tract's susceptibility to infectious pathogens that can lead to bovine respiratory disease (BRD; Loerch and Fluharty, 1999) , which is considered the biggest health challenge facing the cattle industry (Duff and Galyean, 2007) . Alternative weaning strategies such as fence line weaning (Nicol, 1977) and 2-stage weaning with a plastic nose weaning clip (Haley et al., 2001) have been investigated and both strategies positively influence behavior (Price et al., 2003; Haley et al., 2005) ; however, impacts on performance are inconclusive.",

            "text": "Trace minerals (TMs) are essential to the health and growth of cattle (Underwood and Suttle, 1999) . Newly weaned and received cattle are often stressed and have a decreased dry matter intake (DMI; Ceciliani et al., 2012) , which could result in limited TM intake. In addition, the status of newly received animals entering a feedlot is largely unknown and is challenging for producers to assess. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) recommends increasing diet TM concentrations for stressed cattle to 150% that of normal requirements. An injectable trace mineral (ITM) may ensure each animal receives the targeted amount of TM (Arthington et al., 2014) regardless of initial TM status, stress level, and eating behavior. However, likely due to variations in initial mineral status across herds, performance responses to ITM at times of weaning and receiving have been variable (Richeson and Kegley, 2011; Arthington et al., 2014; Genther-Schroeder and Hansen, 2015) .",

            "text": "Due to the segmented nature of the beef industry, calves are often abruptly weaned and then transported directly to a feedlot or backgrounding facility. These calves exhibit increased behavioral stress, with excess walking and vocalization (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1989 ) that can lead to an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections (Loerch and Fluharty, 1999) . In addition, even with an adequate TM status (though this is often unknown), due to this additional stress, these animals may also have a greater TM requirement. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that an ITM may be most beneficial in the more stressed, abruptly weaned calves. Steers were housed in two identical barns that were adjacent to each other and were separated by weaning strategy. The authors acknowledge that weaning strategy is potentially confounded by barn; however, calves were segregated by weaning strategy to minimize the impact of calf behavior from one weaning treatment on calf behavior in the other treatment. There were no weaning strategy \u00d7 ITM interactions for BW or ADG throughout the experiment. In contrast, experiments by Arthington et al. (2014) and Genther-Schroeder and Hansen (2015) showed that stressed calves that received an ITM actually had decreased ADG initially following stress compared to calves receiving saline injections. Genther-Schroeder and Hansen (2015) then followed those calves' performance for the remainder of a 78-d growing period and noted no effect of an ITM on calf ADG. This is also in contrast to this experiment, where there was a tendency for ITM to improve overall (day 0 to 124) ADG. Arthington et al. (2014) also reported a trend for ITM to increase ADG in growing heifers.",

Genther-Shroeder and Hansen (2015) reported no effect of an ITM on efficiency of stressed calves during the growing period. This is in contrast to Richeson and Kegley (2011) who reported that highly stressed newly received calves that received an ITM had increased G:F compared to their untreated counterparts. The effect of weaning strategy on G:F in saline-treated calves only was unexpected. Although it is common for two-stage weaned calves to have improved performance initially following weaning, compared to their conventionally weaned counterparts (Haley et al., 2005) , it is unclear why the 2SAL calves exhibited increased efficiency compared to their AbtSAL for the overall period of day 0 to 124, yet there were no differences between 2MM and AbtMM. Arthington et al. (2014) noted that an ITM increased numerous acute phase proteins. This increase in acute phase proteins could result in a modulation of metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and protein (Gruys et al., 2005) potentially impacting an animal's growth and efficiency. As mineral status nor acute phase proteins were not assessed in this experiment, it is unknown if perhaps these data would have helped to explain the results. The cattle utilized in these previous experiments were subjected to only shipping stress, whereas the cattle in this experiment experienced the culmination of both shipping and weaning stressors. The overall minimal ITM effect may be due to the fact that these calves came from well-managed University herds and likely had an adequate TM status. However, this was not measured in this study.",

This is supported by Hickey et al. (2003) and Lefcourt and Elsasser (1995) who also reported no effect of weaning on cortisol response. Due to the limited sampling time points in this experiment and that these calves came from a well-managed herd and were used to human interaction, it is possible that peak cortisol concentrations that may have been associated with weaning were simply missed.

Although authors expected abruptly weaned steers to spend more time walking after separation due to greater stress, it is difficult to explain why AbtMM steers walked more than AbtSAL steers. As hypothesized, the current study showed that two-stage weaned steers vocalize less frequently than abruptly weaned steers on both days 1 and 2 and there was a lower percentage of two-stage weaned steers standing and walking on day 1 compared to abruptly weaned steers. In addition, two-stage weaned steers spent more time lying on day 1 and eating on both days 1 and 2 compared to abruptly weaned steers. This is similar to previous observations (Haley et al., 2001 (Haley et al., , 2005 ) that on days 2 and 3 after separation that calves weaned in two stages with the use of anti-suckling nose flaps walk less, spend more time eating, more time lying, and less time standing than calves weaned by traditional abrupt separation. These mentioned findings clearly demonstrate that two-stage weaned calves display less behavioral signs of stress upon separation from the dam than calves weaned by the traditional abrupt separation method. However, calves were not observed for behavior and vocalizations during the 6 d while nose flaps were inserted in two-stage weaned calves, so there is no data to compare behavioral stress of treatment groups prior to separation. Though cortisol levels were not different, based on behavior parameters, it is possible that the two-stage weaned calves were not as stressed upon entering the feedlot compared to the abruptly weaned calves. However, a potentially more complicated interaction between ITM and level of stress may exist.",

In addition, ITM had no effect on calf BW or behavior, but increased overall DMI in two-stage weaned calves compared to abruptly weaned calves and tended to increase overall ADG regardless of weaning strategy. Further research evaluating the interaction of weaning strategy and ITM in stressed at-risk cattle needs to be conducted before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
