This assay employs an extraction procedure of viral RNA from specimens collected by nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. The second step in the assay employs reverse transcription and amplification using a real time PCR instrumentation. The assay therefore requires two kits, one for extraction and another for amplification of the target and detection. We investigated whether a strategy used in the testing of blood prior to transfusion could have application for conservation of scarce reagents for the SARS CoV-2 assay 4,5 . The process of group testing that employs sample pooling is used for detection of the human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses 4 in blood products. Key principles for successful application of group testing involve knowledge of the limit-of-detection, sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the prevalence of disease in the population. The goal of the process is to determine a pool size that provides the greatest conservation of resources while maintaining the reliable performance of testing.",

With this assay, a positive COVID-19 result was determined when both nucleocapsid targets (N1 and N2) reached a defined threshold prior to an amplification cycle of 40. COVID-19 positive specimens with a range of cycle threshold (Ct) values from 18.23 to 37.96 for N1 and from 17.33 to 38.65 for N2 were included in this study (Table 1). Note that a low Ct values indicated the presence of higher amounts of viral RNA and high Ct values indicated lower amounts. Pools were created using 50 \u00b5l from a confirmed NP positive patient specimen added to 50 \u00b5l from each of 4 negative NP patient samples for a final volume of 250 \u00b5l. Nucleic acid (NA) extraction was performed on each pool using either the QIAGEN EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) or the QIAGEN manual extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the extracted NA using the CDC Diagnostic Panel following the manufacturer's instructions. The results showed that all 21pooled specimens were positive within a range of -1.1 Ct to 5.09 Ct difference from the original samples",
