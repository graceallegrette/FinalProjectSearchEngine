            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has infected more than one million 2 people, and has led to more than 80,000 deaths, at the time of preparation of this 3 manuscript [1, 23, 25, 28] . The virus is an enveloped and single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus 30kb 4 base-pairs (bps), , which belongs to the family Coronaviridae [6, 27] . Since the year 2000, we have 5 witnessed and experienced three highly widespread pathogenic coronaviruses in human populations - 6 the other two viruses are SARS-COV in 2002-2003, and MERS-CoV in 2012 [4] . All three viruses can 7 lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the human host, which may cause pulmonary 8 fibrosis,and lead to permanent lung function reduction or death [2, 20, 22] . The mechanisms of these 9 severe cases remain unclear. 10 No drug is currently confirmed to be effective against SARS-COV-2. Some vaccine candidates are 11 under intensive studies [12] . A nucleotide analog RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor 12 called remdesivir has demonstrated effects on SARS-COV-2 [19] . Hoffmann et al. suggested that 13 TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use can be adopted as a treatment option [9] . In silico methods 14 have as well produced lists of potential drugs [7] and epitopes [16] worthy of further exploration. 15 However, short of details on how the viral molecule compromises the cells of hosts, it is hard to prioritize 16 our exploration of the huge array of potential drugs and therapies. Analysis of the mechanism can false negatives, one approach is to amplify the viral sequences with multiplex reverse transcription 21 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by sequencing the amplicons with third generation 22 sequencing technologies such as the Nanopore devices. The approach has been applied to sequence the 23 dengue [21] and Zika viruses [17] , as well as in the SARS-COV-2 viruses [14] . 24 Nanopore sequencing generate long reads, which enable the detection of large genomic structural 25 changes, viral recombination and viral integration into host genome. They also supports alternative 26 splicing analyses of microorganism studies [3] . However, The long reads suffers high error rates. 27 Detection of the viral and host gene expressions using amplicons is further complicated by several factors. 28 First, the sub-sequences can be amplified unevenly. Second, reads in the gene region amplified from the 29 viral genome are indistinguishable from the gene transcripts. Third, chimeric reads are frequent. 30 Here, we developed a computational tool, CovProfile, to detect viral genomic variations, and profile 31 viral gene expressions through data from multiplex RT-PCR Amplicon Sequencing on Nanopore 32 GridION. To detect the genomic variations, we mapped the reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome 33 (MN908947.3), and to profile the viral gene expressions, we adopt a regularization method to find out 34 the primer efficiencies, We have tested the tool on the data obtained from the sputum samples in eleven 35 severe COVID-19 patients. We found seven out of eleven patients are infected by two strains, and 36 discovered no structural variations. We found that the expression of viral genes ORF1ab gene, S gene, M 37 gene, and N gene are high among most of the samples. While performing our tests, we noticed the 38 abundances of MUC5B transcript segments to be consistently higher than those of other genes in host.",

These chimeric reads could be split into several segments with their bilateral ends exactly 53 matching the sites where the multiplex PCR primers are located, suggesting that they should be 54 processed accurately to avoid false positive identification of virus recombinations or host integrations. 55 We position primers on both viral and host genome, and splits the identified chimeric reads into segments 56 corresponding to PCR amplicons.

However, the 164 coverage unevenness caused by efficiency differences in the multiplex primers impedes our calculation of 165 pathogenic genes expression. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-parameter method which 166 considers the primer efficiency, gene differential expressions, and RNA virus genome copy number find that viral gene ORF1ab may maintain higher expression than other genes across most samples. This 172 viral gene occupied a large region on SARS-CoV-2 genome, and it responsible for the amplification and 173 assembly of the virus [15] . For the primer, the multiplex primers efficiency has wide distribution in single 174 sample, and the distributions among samples demonstrate similar trend. This suggests that our 175 estimation of primers efficiency comply to the reality. 176 We utilize the sequencing data to evaluate host genome expression and find several genes consistently 177 activated in the majority of samples after eliminating the PCR effects. The most abundant gene is the 178 MUC5B, which encodes a member of the mucin protein family. The family proteins are the major 179 components of mucus secretions in normal lung mucus [18] . MUC5B has been reported to be highly 180 expressed in lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Based on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 in 11 samples, we discovered 104 38 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in total; 35 of them are located on the genetic regions, 105 including gene ORF1ab, S, N and M. Gene ORF1ab contained 23 SNPs in 11 samples, and 17 of them 106 were non-synonymous mutations. Non-synonymous mutations also occupied a large part of SNPs in the 107 gene S, N and M: 5 of 8 SNPs in gene S, 1 of 3 SNPs in gene N, and 1 of 1 SNPs in gene M were 108non-synonymous mutations. Since most of the SNPs were located in only 1 sample, we deduced that the 109 functions of the discovered SNPs need to be further verified according to lab experiments. Surprisingly, 110 we also found that 7 among 11 samples were heterogeneous at loci 8782. This may imply that the hosts 111 have two different virus strains. However, we did not find creditable InDels (Insertions and Deletions), or 112 structural variations, viral-host integration during the mutation analysis.113Evaluations on the amplification efficient for the primers114    Since 98 pairs of primers from two pools were designed for the enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 genome 115 before sequencing, we discovered that different parts of SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibited different coverage 116 depths. We then calculated the amplification efficiencies for the primers with our proposed method. We 117 discovered that the primers located at the 5' and 3' ends of the SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibited higher 118 amplification efficiency (>1.2,Figure 4), including primer01 and primer84-primer93. With the genomic 119 locations of the primers, we know that the genomic sequences within the ranges 24-410 and120 25,280-28,464 can be amplified with more sequencing data. On the other hand, the remaining primers 121 exhibited slightly lower efficiencies, within the range of 1.0-1.2. For primers 64, 70, 83 and 85, their 122 amplification efficiencies were as low as 1, which indicates that the target regions of these primers were 123 not amplified. Based on the primer efficiencies, the effect of data bias which was induced by the PCR 124 experiments can be attenuated from the original data, and they can be further applied for the 125 normalization of viral gene expression under different primers. 126 Normalized coverage depth on SARS-CoV-2 genome 127",
