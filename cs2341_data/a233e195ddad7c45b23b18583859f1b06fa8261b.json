The percentage improvement in growth response of weaned pigs fed diets with SDP compared to diets without SDP is greater if pigs are housed in unsanitary versus sanitary conditions (Coffey and Cromwell, 1995; Zhao et al., 2007) . Housing weaned pigs in unsanitary conditions can be used in feeding studies to differentiate the potential growth-enhancing effects of various specialty proteins used in diets. Two experiments were designed with the objective to compare growth of pigs housed in unsanitary conditions and fed non-medicated diets with different levels of APP or SDPP in Exp. 1 and diets with APP, EHSY, IEGG, or a combination of APP, EHSY, and fish meal compared to SDBP in Exp. 2. The hypothesis for both experiments was that growth of weaned pigs housed in unsanitary conditions and fed non-medicated diets containing these specialty proteins is equivalent to that of pigs fed diets containing either SDPP or SDBP.",

Unsanitary pens were used as an attempt to increase post-weaning stress on pigs so that potential bioactivity of the studied specialty proteins on pig growth could be better differentiated when compared to soy protein concentrate (SPC) as a negative control specialty protein and SDPP or SDBP as the respective positive control specialty protein used in Exp. 1 and 2.

Other research has observed similar results for ADG of pigs fed diets with SDPP compared to SPC as observed in Exp. 1 (Torrallardona, 2010) . Recently, Pujols et al. (2016) reported that ADG and BW were increased during the initial 2 wk post-weaning when 6% SDPP was included in the diet compared to SPC, however no differences for ADG or average BW among starter diets was observed at d 48, although mortality was reduced at d 48 and 145 and carcass weight was increased for pigs previously fed SDPP in the starter diet. The increased ADG and BW of pigs fed diets with SDPP during the initial 2 wk after weaning may or may not be maintained to the end of the nursery phase depending on the severity of post-weaning stress, ability of pigs to recover, and the incidence and degree of subsequent stress later in the nursery. The stress associated with weaning may have consequences on intestinal barrier function resulting in compromised performance in later life stages. Use of SDP in starter diets has been demonstrated to attenuate some of the effects of barrier dysfunctions associated with weaning stress (Peace et al., 2011; Boyer et al., 2015) .",

Published research with APP is limited. The provision of 0.2% APP in feed for mature gilts challenged with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) reduced rectal temperature, PRRSV load (RNA copies/ml) and serum IL-1 and increased serum IL-18, suggesting that APP had immunomodulatory effects that benefit gilts with PRRSV . Improvements in productivity have also been reported for PRRSV positive sows provided 0.5% SDPP in gestation and lactation feed (Campbell et al., 2006) . Another study reported that 0.1% APP in gestation and lactation diets reduced percentage of small pigs at birth and wean to estrus interval of sows, increased weaning weight of pigs, and increased postweaning growth of pigs to the end of the nursery period, while addition of 0.3% APP to nursery diets improved ADG of pigs only during the early post-weaning period .

As observed in Exp. 1 with SDPP diets, pens in Exp. 2 provided the SDBP diet did not have any pens with a negative ADG at d 7, while all other specialty protein diets had 10 to 50% of the pens with negative ADG. However, across all non-SDBP diets, some pens fed the different specialty protein diets had a maximum ADG above the minimum ADG for SDBP, suggesting that local pen environment may have influenced growth response to diets, but that the other specialty proteins did not consistently enhance growth performance compared to the SDBP diet under the experimental conditions of unsanitary pens and non-use of medication.",

The level of 0.4% APP used in the APP and CB diets were based on supplier recommendations at the time of the experiment. Both diets containing APP resulted in lower performance than the SDBP diet and no performance differences compared to SPC, EHSY, or IEGG. One publication has indicated improved growth of pigs provided 0.30% APP in nursery diets but only in the early post-weaning period . The diet with a combination Translate basic science to industry innovation of EHSY, APP, and fish meal was designed to provide a complex mixture of plant and animal proteins with 0.40% APP to compare against 0.40% APP and 7.49% SPC. However, performance of pigs fed the CB diet did not differ from any of the non-SDBP diets and resulted in inferior performance compared to the SDBP diet. This observation is consistent with data indicating that PRRSV positive pigs fed a nursery diet regimen containing combinations of SPC, egg/fish pepton, highly processed poultry protein, yeast culture, and other feed additives had lower ADG and BW and higher mortality at the end of the nursery period (d 49 post-weaning) compared with pigs fed a less complex nursery diet regimen containing SDBP (Crenshaw et al., 2017) .",

The IEGG product used in Exp. 2 was spray-dried whole egg product (IEGG) derived from hens strategically vaccinated against various strains of Escherichia coli, Lawsonia intracellularis, rotavirus, coronavirus, Clostridia sp., and Salmonella sp., to produce specific IgY antibodies against these pathogens. Reasons for lack of a growth response to feeding the IEGG product are unknown but may have been related to either absence or overabundance of specific pathogens in the environment for which the specific IgY antibodies from the IEGG product could potentially impact. Pathogen-specific challenge studies have indicated similar improvements in performance for pigs fed hyperimmunized egg yolk products compared with pigs fed SDPP when pigs were challenged with pathogens common to the specific IgY antibodies contained in the egg product (Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2002) . However, like Exp. 2 with SDBP, under non-specific pathogen challenge with unsanitary pens, pigs fed diets containing SDPP had improved growth performance compared with that of pigs fed a control diet, and a hyper-immunized egg yolk product did not increase performance over the control group .",

In Exp. 2, activated porcine plasma, enzymatically hydrolyzed soy and yeast protein, spray dried whole eggs from hyper-immunized hens, or a combination of fish meal, activated porcine plasma, and enzymatically hydrolyzed soy and yeast protein did not improve performance of pigs compared to diets with soy protein concentrate and none of the specialty proteins used in Exp. 2 provided equivalent performance to a diet containing spray-dried bovine plasma. Therefore, we were not able to confirm the hypothesis that growth performance of weaned pigs housed in unsanitary conditions and fed non-medicated diets containing the tested specialty proteins were equivalent to that of pigs fed diets containing either spray-dried porcine or bovine plasma.",

Variance in amino acid composition between different origins of SDP used at 5% of the diet are not likely to contribute substantial differences in amino acid composition of the complete diet any more so than the variation of amino acid profile among other ingredients reported by NRC (2012) for corn, soybean meal, whey or the other specialty ingredients provided by suppliers.
