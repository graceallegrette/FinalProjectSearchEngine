Genetic recombination implicated in the emergence of (MERSCoV), virulence host adaptation, transmission and other zoonotic and epidemiological features, this study was conducted to evaluate the genetic relationship among Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) of human and camels' origin at the period from October 2015 to February 2016. Hundred samples were collected from camel and 100 from human. Camel,Human and camel samplescarried out by RNA extraction100 human nasal swaps and bronchial lavage samples were collected from pilgrims and non-pilgrims, the total positive result was 5%. The pilgrims recorded the highest infection rate. The result of conventional PCR for detection of Ngene (217 bp) of MERSCoV was confirmative, three humans and 11 camel positive samples were used in further sequencing and phylogenetic analysis by extraction and purification of the PCR products. Our clones sequence submitted in GenBank-NCPI and took their accession number. variants of camel and human were located in Clade-B in which Saudi Arabia strains were clustered. One of our clones (MERS-Iq.2Huh) of accession number KX150500.1 was located in clade-A in the same branch of Jordanian strain. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERSCoV) is widely spread in Arabian Peninsula and many other Middle East countries surrounded of Iraq [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . It has become one of the most important emerging human health threating virus [6] . MERSCoV is beta corona virus within coronaviridaefamily which are enveloped, positive sense RNA genome with nucleocapsid of helical symmetry infect human and variety of animal species [7] . The ability of high recombination, unique viral replication and low fidelity of corona virus polymerases allows for unexpected viral evolution to infect other host . [8, 9 ] Phylogenetic analysis of African bat virus belonging to the same species of MERSCoV and indicate that the evolution of the virus in camels precede that in human suggesting the possible spreading from bats to camels took place in Africa and involved exchange of genetic materials among ancestral virus strains [10, 11] Nucleocapsid gene (N gene) is common target for cloning phylogenetic analysis and generation recombinants portions. N protein is highly immunogenic phosphoprotein and modulation of cell signaling method. The N gene has been used for corona virus genotyping and phylogenetic analysis which helped our knowledge of virus temporal geographic origins and evolution [12, 13] . This study was conducted to evaluate the genetic relationship among local circulating MERSCoV variants in human and camel at the first time in Iraq.",
