Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.",

WHO says \"People who cough or sneeze are more likely to spread the virus,\u2026 But even if they do, asymptomatic transmission likely plays a minor role in the epidemic overall.\" Additionally, evidence from Germany reported that 2 out of 114 travelers (1.8%) from Wuhan, China, who had passed the symptoms-based screening tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [8] .",

In this regard, body temperature might not be an adequate screening as it can potentially miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel and contribute to the importation of the virus to the countries of destination. Therefore, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas [1] and/or 14-day quarantine [15] of people coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 [6, 8] . Lastly, in previous experience from other viral outbreaks, i.e., dengue virus [16] and Ebola [17] , fever screening especially at airport had a positive effect on partially blocking importation of cases. Kuan et al. [16] reported that airport fever screening was successful in identifying 45% (244/542; 95% confidence interval 33.1-57.8%) of imported dengue cases with fever. ",
