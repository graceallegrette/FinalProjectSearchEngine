Nucleic acid amplification tests could assist antibiotic targeting. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 645 patients presenting to primary care with acute cough and suspected ALRTI, provided throat swabs at baseline. These were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction and classified as having a respiratory virus, bacteria, both or neither. Three hundred fifty-four participants scored the symptoms severity daily for 1 week in a diary (0 = absent to 4 = severe problem). Results: Organisms were identified in 346/645 (53.6%) participants. There were differences in the prevalence of seven symptoms between the organism groups at baseline. Those with a virus alone, and those with both virus and bacteria, had higher average severity scores of all symptoms combined during the week of follow-up than those in whom no organisms were detected [adjusted mean differences 0.204 (95% confidence interval 0.010 to 0.398) and 0.348 (0.098 to 0.598), respectively]. There were no differences in the duration of symptoms rated as moderate or severe between organism groups. Conclusions: Differences in presenting symptoms and symptoms severity can be identified between patients with viruses and bacteria identified on throat swabs. The magnitude of these differences is unlikely to influence management. Most patients had mild symptoms at 7 days regardless of aetiology, which could inform patients about likely symptom duration.",

Oropharyngeal swabs have also been used in studies on respiratory infections in children (24) , have the advantage of being available in nearly all patients, and improve uptake with busy clinicians and patients (24) . Therefore, they are of practical value as a future site for simple point of care testing. The study had sufficient power for comparison to patients where no bacteria or viruses were found but limited power for comparisons between groups where bacteria or viruses were found. For the primary analysis of diary data, we used a similar classification of bacteria as pathogens as the GRACE study (4) but including the full panel of bacteria in sensitivity analyses did not alter our conclusions. We had intended to investigate recovery for individual organisms with a prevalence >10%, but due to our limited sample size, we could only investigate Picornavirus and H. influenzae. Thus, our grouping of individual organisms into broader groups may have obscured potentially important relationships that only much larger studies would be powered to detect. In past smokers, we observed significant differences in time since smoking cessation between organism groups, but as this variable was not associated with outcomes, we did not adjust for it in multivariable models.",

In our study, the mean score for all symptoms declined over the 7 days and less than half described their symptoms as more than moderate. We used the mean symptom severity score on Days 2 to 4 after presentation since this is the period when symptoms are rated as worse by patients (23) but, although there were differences between groups, these were small and unlikely to be meaningful to patients. Nucleic acid amplification tests cannot distinguish between colonizing and causative organisms. In the GRACE study, viruses were found significantly more commonly in symptomatic illness and when these patients recovered (35) , the same viruses were found at a similar prevalence to those in controls again (4) . There have been similar findings in children (24) . Although we did not include controls or follow-up samples, seven symptoms were more common in patients with viral infections, regardless of whether they also had a bacterial infection, than in patients with a bacterial or no infection. Since neither the clinicians nor the patients were aware of the throat swab result at the time, it is unlikely bias accounted for these differences.",
