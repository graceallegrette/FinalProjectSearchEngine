The observed effect for maternal asthma remained significant after adjusting for important confounders (detailed in Table 2 Figure 4) .

However, when the mother was asthmatic, hMPV infection did not significantly increase the risk of having LTD compared to those without viral detections (Supplementary Table 1 ). Finally, given the rate of hMPV coinfections with RSV in our population (20% of hMPV infections), we explored whether hMPV played an instrumental role in the association between maternal asthma and LTD, or the effect was potentially attributable to effects of RSV. In the subgroup of children with hMPV infections in the absence of RSV (hMPV single infections and coinfections with hRV or influenza A), maternal asthma promoted LTD (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.12-12.88; P = .03).

The immune response against hMPV is complex [4] . The virus has been reported to trigger Th2 cytokines through thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Th-17 responses via the release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-17, and IL-6 [17, 18, [33] [34] [35] . Interestingly, asthma and pregnancy itself also elicit a Th2 [28, 36, 37] and Th17 [38] [39] [40] bias. In studies analyzing other health metrics, maternal asthma has been previously associated with poor maternal (gestational diabetes and placenta previa), perinatal (preterm birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia), and neonatal (severe hRV LRTI, neonatal death, and hospitalizations) outcomes [28, 29] .",

Perhaps this phenomenon is explained in part by \"viral interference, \" when one virus totally or partially blocks the replication of the other pathogen [45] . However, the role for hMPV as a coinfecting agent is still unclear and requires further study [46] [47] [48] . In a changing epidemiological landscape driven by preventive interventions against RSV, hMPV may soon alter its role and overall importance as a childhood pathogen should viral replacement occur [49] . Targeting children of asthmatic mothers for prophylaxis against hMPV may be a cost-effective strategy in the era of personalized medicine.",

Second, given the age of our subjects and the prospective nature of this program, whether severity depended causally on maternal disease versus infant atopy/asthma cannot be answered. Third, given the observational nature of our study design focused on generating new hypotheses, no adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Additional research is needed to confirm the role of maternal asthma as a risk factor for severity in hMPV-infected children. However, our program also has significant strengths, including its prospective design and the evaluation of respiratory samples using state-of-the-art laboratory RT-PCR techniques. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first population-based study seeking to define the burden of hMPV disease in a vulnerable population from a low-or middleincome country. In addition, this large study addressed numerous prenatal and perinatal risk factors, examining how they modify the severity of infection.",
