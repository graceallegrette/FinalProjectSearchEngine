On February 16, the first case without epidemiologic link was reported, and the authorities concerned the community transmission of the disease. 1 From mid-February, the number of COVID-19 cases has exploded. The KCDC had raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest from orange to red on February 23, 2020. 1 The government strengthened the overall nonpharmaceutical intervention measures because antiviral agents and vaccines were not developed. The government screened high-risk groups which had close contact with confirmed cases and recommended minimizing social gathering and outdoor activities to the public. School closures were also one of the nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Since the epidemic was expected to continue in March, the public concerned about the possibility of massively increased cases in school-aged children who have high close contacts among them. The Ministry of Education decided to delay school-opening by 7 days from March 2 to March 9 to reduce the risk of infection among school children on February 23. 1 On March 2, it was announced that the opening of schools would be further postponed for an additional 14 days from March 9. 1 As COVID-19 epidemic continues, an additional 14-daydelay from March 23 was announced on March 17. 2 There is a controversial issue between a possibility of a massive outbreak and education for children. In this study, it is aimed to quantify the potential effects of delay of school opening as the epidemic progressed through mathematical modeling. We investigate the potential effect as the child-to-child transmission increased after the school opening. The expected number of cases to occur when the school was opened as scheduled without delaying the school opening is calculated.",
