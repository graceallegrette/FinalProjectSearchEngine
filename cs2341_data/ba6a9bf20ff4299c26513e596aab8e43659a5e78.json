This article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in Saudi Arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection. The approach taken toward managing this high-risk situation (COVID-19) could be easily adopted by health care organizations and would be helpful to ensure readiness for the occurrence of future outbreaks of different infectious etiologies like those recent episodes of new coronavirus.",

The provision of cancer care is complex and requires multiple teams of professionals with specialized expertise and access to sophisticated, expensive resources. The complexity of cancer care already presents major challenges to the health care systems in affluent countries; national reports from both the United States and United Kingdom identified the crisis situation already faced in the provision of this care. [4] [5] [6] This is the situation internationally in normal daily practice without external complicating factors, such as war or infectious outbreaks. One can imagine the challenges that arise in developing countries while facing such external crises, which present an additional burden to inherently complex care. 7, 8 MERS-CoV was the cause of multiple outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, which spread internationally. [9] [10] [11] The outbreak of MERS-CoV in June 2015 led to the closure of our hospital, as well as other hospitals within the city of Riyadh. 12 This crisis posed a serious challenge to our staff and patients. The Oncology Department, in particular, faced unique challenges because of many factors, including infected oncology patients, a large susceptible patient population, interruption of services provided to our patients, and additional risks to our staff.",
