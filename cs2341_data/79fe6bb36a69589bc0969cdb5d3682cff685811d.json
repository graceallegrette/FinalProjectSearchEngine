In particular, the supply of N95 respirator masks has become severely depleted with supplies having to be rationed and health care workers having to use masks for prolonged periods in many countries. We sought to test the ability of 4 different decontamination methods including autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and vaporized hydrogen peroxide exposure to decontaminate 4 different N95 masks of experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 cycle. This last finding may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings.",

Without an adequate supply of N95 masks, health care providers are at extreme risk of acquisition of COVID19 disease.

VSV was used if the decontamination method was only available at hospital.

One of the four respirator masks were placed into each of the four decontamination devices (16 respirator masks in total) after the mixture had dried.

In particular, the depletion of single-use disposable personal protective gear has resulted in considerable health care worker anxiety and prolonged use of gear far beyond standard recommendations. The international shortage of N95 masks that protect from aerosolized virus (which may occur during intubation and other invasive tracheobronchial procedures) is of particular concern given the respiratory nature of the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The shortage of these masks and their use for periods beyond recommended may be part of the reason for the reported high incidence of acquisition of infection by health care workers.",

The process is somewhat more complex than others and there can be safety concerns in that the gas is flammable, explosive and potentially carcinogenic [11] .

This result in an extremely long cycle time of more than 20 hours compared to less than one hour for other decontamination methods. Despite these drawbacks, some institutions in poorly resourced setting may not have iHP or VHP. For that reason, our finding that all four mask models tolerate at least 3 cycles of EtO decontamination without significant structural or functional deterioration may be useful.

The other layered fabric, pleated models all retained integrity with up to 10 autoclave cycles. This finding will be highly relevant to institutions in poorly resourced areas of the world in that one might reasonably hope that autoclaves would be available in any recognized hospital around the world.

This risks functional failure of N95 masks, spread of infection to wearers and increased risk of virus transmission from health care workers to others. Our data suggests that all decontamination methods are effective for at least one decontamination cycle without loss of structural integrity. However, neither iHP nor EtO gas are recommended at this time due to limited tolerance of N95 masked tested to repeat cycles, prolonged cycle times and/or potential toxicity. Both VHP and autoclaving can be used to decontaminate N95 masks through multiple cycles without loss of filtering function. Although VHP has more limited availability, autoclaves, which can be used on a subset of N95 mask types, may be easily accessed by any health care institution when N95 mask shortages occur.",
