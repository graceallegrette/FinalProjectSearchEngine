For TI and TE, the values were taken with step = 0.1 in their respective intervals. For R 0 , the values were taken with step = 0.01 from 1 to 5. Since there are three parameters in the model, we defined the value of TE, TI and R 0 as a parameter combination. The number of individuals infected (\u00ce) and recovered (\u0212) for each parameter combination was calculated by substituting the values of these three parameters into the SEIR model. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of each parameter combination was calculated by following formula: where \u00ce and \u0212 are estimated number of the infected and the recovered, I and R are real number of the infected and the recovered we collected. For all combinations of these three parameters, we selected the parameters which had the smallest value of RMSE (I) + RMSE (R) as the optimal TE, TI, and R 0 . In order to avoid model over-fitting with this method, we randomly sampled 80% of the data for fitting each time, and repeated this for 100 times, and finally we used the average of the fitted TI, TE and R 0 for 100 times as the model' s optimal TI, TE and R 0 .",

The results showed that the number of infected people increased slowly in the early stage (January 22 -January 31), but during February 1 -February 12, the number of infected people increased rapidly, which is expected to peak around February 19, reaching about 47 000 people. Subsequently, the number of infections will decrease. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and the epidemic would end around the end of March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase.",

This study used the latest 2019 nCoV data in Wuhan area, analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 2019 nCoV epidemic after Wuhan city was shut down. Compared with other studies, the R 0 value produced in this study is smaller, indicating that the closure and subsequent measures have played an important role in the spread of the epidemic.",
