            "text": "On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID-19 outbreak. Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a governmentapproved isolation centre in Lagos State. This first mortality was that of a 67-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom. The novel COVID-19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer. Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery. This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients' and oncology professionals' physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies to ensure that cancer care is not completely disrupted during the outbreak.",

For people living with cancer, the diseases will continue to grow in the absence of treatment, therefore cancer may spread, develop resistance to treatments, cause multiple complications or, in some instances, death. To respond to this important area of critical need, government must constitute a multidisciplinary oncology and infectious disease team to create, review and rapidly update a clinical policy for combating COVID-19 infection during cancer care, strategise to reduce clinic visits and accelerate remote online care, empower patients and caregivers through communication using digital technology interventions and leverage on existing digital health platforms in the country. In addition, efforts should be made to support palliative and supportive care of people with advanced cancer during the outbreak by systematically identifying critical areas for consideration and development in the context of the availability of resources and expertise in resource-constrained settings such as Nigeria.",
