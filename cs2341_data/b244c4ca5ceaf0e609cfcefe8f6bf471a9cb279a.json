So far, several studies have attempted to elucidate the case fatality ratios for different population segments and geographic regions particularly based on epidemiological data from China [8] [9] [10] . However, there is still a scarcity of studies carefully documenting the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in populations outside China. Accumulating epidemiological data indicates that the CFR varies by geographical location, intensity of transmission, characteristics of patients such as age, sex, and comorbidity status [9] . For example, the timedelay adjusted CFR for Wuhan was estimated at 12.2% compared to 4.2% for Hubei province excluding Wuhan and 0.9% in China excluding Hubei province [11] . Rough differences in severity of the pandemic in different countries have been highlighted [10] . However, there is a need to quantify spatial variability in CFR and investigate how this variability is influenced by population factors and the characteristics of the health care system.",

This trend was also reported for the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea in which the risk of death was significantly associated with older age and underlying health condition[23]. In the early phase of the outbreak of emerging infectious disease like MERS and COVID-19, the detection rate of mildly symptomatic cases is low and only patients who have serious conditions are confirmed due to hospitalization as happened in Wuhan[24] [11] and South Korea[23]. However the downward trend of CFR in the later phase of epidemic suggests both an improvement in epidemiologic surveillance and a decline in the proportion of vulnerable patients [11]. Because of the decline in the proportion of vulnerable patients and an increased detection of mildly symptomatic cases, the epidemic might get prolonged unless strict social/physical distancing measures are applied [11].",

When we compare the adjusted CFR of the most affected regions in Italy and China, the estimate for Italy is more than 2.5 times the estimate for China (31.4% vs 12.2%)[11]. This difference may be partly associated with the population structure of the two countries as suggested in a previous study [20]. Italy has an older population compared to China. In 2015 the median age of total population in Italy was 45.4 years compared to 36.7 years for China [21]. In 2019, approximately 23% of population in Italy was 65 years and older [20] compared to 12.6% in China[22].",
