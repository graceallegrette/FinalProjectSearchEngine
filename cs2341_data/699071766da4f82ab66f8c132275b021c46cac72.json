Methods: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b w ), and the effective reproduction number (R eff ) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b w during the transmission, we performed a \"knock-out\" simulation in four scenarios:",

In developing countries, Shigella spp are one of the top four attributable causes of moderate-severe diarrhea in children younger than 5 years. Shigellosis is an illness that kills roughly 750,000 people per year [3] [4] [5] . Although the incidence of shigellosis has declined remarkably due to the rapid improvements in water supply and sanitation in China [6] , a considerable disease burden still exists and is unevenly distributed across the country [7] [8] [9] . Because of the different transmission conditions resulted from socialeconomic factors such as water supply and hygiene practices in different areas, the transmission of shigellosis is heterogeneous and is still a major public health problem in many areas in China [7, 10, 11] . The transmission interruption has a public importance in China as well as many developing countries. Generally, whether an infectious disease spreads or not depends on the size of transmissibility or \"transmission force\" behind the transmission. However, to our knowledge, there is no study investigating the transmissibility of shigellosis. Therefore, an understanding the transmissibility of shigellosis is of great significance to ensure a better disease prevention and control.",

However, because of the disease intervention or the decreasing proportion of susceptible individuals due to the spread of the pathogen, it is hard to estimate R 0 . Therefore, effective reproduction number (R eff ) is commonly employed instead, with the definition of the number of new cases which was produced by a typical case during the period of infection [16, 17] . From the definition, it is clear that when R eff > 1, the disease is able to spread in the population. If R eff < 1, the infection will be cleared from the population. Therefore, R eff = 1 is considered as the \"epidemic threshold\".",

For the route of person-to-person, two routes (symptomatic-to-susceptible and asymptomatic-to-susceptible) were both considered. In the model, people were divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic (I), asymptomatic (A), and recovered (R) individuals. The reservoir, including water or food, was denoted as W. In order to normalize the dimensions of people and Shigella spp population, we set s = S/N, e = E/N, i = I/N, a = I/A, r = R/N, w = \u03b5W/\u03bcN, b = \u03b2N, and b w = \u03bc\u03b2 W N/\u03b5.",

According to our previous research [19] , k, \u03c9, p, \u03b3, \u03b3', c, and \u03b5 are disease-specific parameters which could be estimated from literatures. The incubation period of shigellosis is 1-4 days [24, 25] , and most commonly 1 day, therefore, \u03c9 = 1.0. The proportion of asymptomatic infection ranges from 0.0037 to 0.27 [26] [27] [28] , and it can be set p = 0.1. The infectious period of symptomatic infection is 13.5 days [19] , therefore, \u03b3 = 0.0741. According to our previous research [19] , the infectious period of asymptomatic infection could be simulated 5 weeks in our model, thus \u03b3' = 0.0286. Because of that the die-off rate of Shigella spp is about 24.5 h [29] , \u03b5 = 0.6931 was consequently simulated [19] . In our previous research [19] , a typical case has diarrhea about 3.2 times (range 3-12 times) per day but an asymptomatic individual only sheds stool once per day, thus c = 0.3125. Due to reduction of shedding frequency, the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic individual (k) was modeled to be a reduced quantity as 0.3125 [19] . However, b and b w are scenario-or area-specific parameters which depend on different outbreaks and periods. Therefore, these two parameters are confirmed by curve fitting by Models 1 and 2 to the collected data. To simulate the contribution of b and b w during the transmission, we performed a \"knock-out\" simulation which was based on the following four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b w = 0; B) b = 0; C) b w = 0; D) control (no intervention). was employed for model simulation and least root mean square was adopted to assess the goodness of fit. The simulation methods were the same as the previously publications [12, 14, 19, 30, 31] . The chi-square and trend chi-square tests and t test were performed by SPSS 13.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).",

The difference between the two parameters was as much as more than seven orders of magnitude in each year ( Table 3) . Results of the \"knock-out\" simulation (Fig. 5) showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A (b = 0 and b w = 0) was almost the same as that simulated by scenario B (b = 0), and that the number of cases simulated by scenario C (b w = 0) was the almost same as that simulated by scenario D (control), (Fig. 6) . The mean value of R eff was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.83-1.34) in the year of 2005. It reached a peak value of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.14-1.65) in 2006. Although it had a lowest value in 2010, it decreased slightly yearly (Table 4 ). By fitting the 11 equations with R eff calculated by the SEIAR model with the reported data, the three most fitting models were Cubic, Linear, and Quadratic ( Table 5 ). The fitted results were shown in Fig. 7 . The Linear and Quadratic models forecasted that the mean value of R eff would decrease yearly. ",

We also found that the incidence of shigellosis in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. It might due to the higher population density in urban areas. However, the transmissibility remains unclear in urban and rural areas and further research is needed to explore the force of the transmission in different areas. About a half of the cases were diagnosed in 1.7 days from their illness onset date. However, this also meant that about 50% of the cases were diagnosed after 1.7 days from their illness onset date.

Therefore, the remained major transmission route is person to person which will be the main public health focus to control the disease. This result also provided a mathematical evidence of the epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis that the pathogen was transmitted primarily through person-to-person [24] .

Therefore, the Linear model was recommended to predict the trends of the transmissibility. The Linear model predicted that the R eff would down to an epidemic threshold (R eff = 1.00) in 2029. This was an interesting result which meant that the disease would probably be eliminated after the year of 2029. But this result was based on the assumption that the transmission condition would remain stable in the future years. Therefore, this trend might be different in other provinces. Hubei Province is located in a lake region with many cities suffered from floods frequently. The transmissibility of Shigellosis would be increased after the flood and provides a potential transmission route of water to person.
