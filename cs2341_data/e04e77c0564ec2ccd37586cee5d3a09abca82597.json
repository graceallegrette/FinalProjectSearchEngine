            "text": "Background and objectives. Diagnostic uncertainty over respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care contributes to over-prescribing of antibiotics and drives antibiotic resistance. If symptoms and signs predict respiratory tract microbiology, they could help clinicians target antibiotics to bacterial infection. This study aimed to determine relationships between symptoms and signs in children presenting to primary care and microbes from throat swabs. Methods. Cross-sectional study of children \u22653 months to <16 years presenting with acute cough and RTI, with subset follow-up. Associations and area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) statistics sought between clinical presentation and baseline microbe detection. Microbe prevalence compared between baseline (symptomatic) and follow-up (asymptomatic) visits. Results. At baseline, \u22651 bacteria was detected in 1257/2113 (59.5%) children and \u22651 virus in 894/2127 (42%) children. Clinical presentation was not associated with detection of \u22651 bacteria [AUROC 0.54 (95% CI 0.52-0.56)] or \u22651 virus [0.64 (95% CI 0.61-0.66)]. Individually, only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with clinical presentation ]. Prevalence fell between baseline and follow-up; more so in viruses (68% versus 26%, P < 0.001) than bacteria (56% versus 40%, P = 0.01); greatest reductions seen in RSV, influenza B and Haemophilus influenzae. Conclusion. Findings demonstrate that clinical presentation cannot distinguish the presence of bacteria or viruses in the upper respiratory tract. However, individual and overall microbe prevalence was greater when children were unwell than when well, providing some evidence that upper respiratory tract microbes may be the cause or consequence of the illness. If causal, selective microbial point-of-care testing could be beneficial.",

Of all paediatric visits for RTI, acute cough is the most common complaint, accounting for up to 75% of visits (4, 5) . Despite this, most RTIs are self-limiting. A 2008 review by the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that antibiotics do not confer a clinically significant reduction in the time taken to recover from an RTI. NICE guidelines recommend that antibiotics are not prescribed for the majority of paediatric RTIs (3) , and in doing so are consistent with the 2011 European Respiratory Society adult prescribing guidelines (6) . However, antibiotic prescribing rates remain high (7) .",

This evidence in isolation is not sufficient, but should be considered alongside evidence from future studies (18) .",

The first is that the microbes are causally linked to the symptoms. A second explanation is that the inflammatory process in the upper respiratory tract allows some microbes to proliferate, making their detection more likely when children are symptomatic (19, 20) . These results are in line with commonly-held views that rhinovirus is associated with mild, non-febrile cold symptoms. They also demonstrate that \u03b2-haemolytic Streptococcus A infection is uncommon in children aged <2 years.",
