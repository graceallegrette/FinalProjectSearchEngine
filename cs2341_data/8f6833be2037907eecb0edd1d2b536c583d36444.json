Importantly, these symptoms are varied for the pregnant women that are reported in the few relevant studies, though not consistent across studies. For instance, Liu et al. 19 identified cough, shortening of breath, and fatigue alongside with fever were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 among pregnant women, whereas cough and fever were reported as vital symptoms of COVID-19 in the Zhu et al. 20 study. The treatments given to the COVID-19 infected pregnant women are also varied. Oxygen support, antiviral therapy, and antibiotic therapy were the treatments had given to the infected pregnant women included in the Liu et al. 21 study. Alternatively, Zhu et al.'s study 20 reported that antibiotic therapy was avoided for all infected pregnant women and had given oxygen support and antiviral therapy. Under these circumstances, summarizing all possible symptoms and treatments are important to assist healthcare personnel; thus, they would able to make evidence-based decision to identify infected women early and provide the most effective treatments. Moreover, knowledge of the possible adverse outcomes would help healthcare personnel to take earlier precautionary measrues. Therefore, this study summarized the symptoms, .
