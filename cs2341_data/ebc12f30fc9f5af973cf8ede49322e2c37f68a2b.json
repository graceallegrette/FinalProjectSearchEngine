Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 affected other parts of the world, with imported cases of infections detected the United Kingdom (UK) in January 2020 [2] . Up to 12 March 2020, the strategy in the UK was to contain the spread of the disease, with suspected cases of COVID-19 referred for clinical assessment and rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing. Sampling of suspected COVID-19 cases requires strict infection control precautions, in an environment that does not risk contamination of healthcare settings. To address this challenge, sampling in the community where possible can contribute to limit the spread of COVID-19 [3] . This report presents community sampling for SARS-CoV2 testing in the Lothian region of Scotland, UK.",

Before sampling in the community is carried out, patients are assessed by telephone by the general practice services for clinically appropriateness to remain home. A second assessment is done by RIDU or PH staff by telephone to check if they meet the case definition for testing. d Transport times are highly variable as dependent on limited resource of specialist ambulance crew, and distance of person to the infectious disease unit. In contrast, community teams are able to attend at person's home so no patient travel time, and they are usually within 1 hour of person's address. e The patient may need to stay longer in the hospital while waiting for the ambulance to be available/ready to take him/her back home. room within the hospital both required terminal cleaning and decontamination following use by a single patient, which further limited resources available. This route was expensive, resource intensive, added pressure to a hospital system already under strain from increased winter admissions. The limited capacity due to the surge of cases in the RIDU led to patients with complex infections being unable to access admission for specialised services. Ultimately, the process for sampling was highly disruptive and difficult, especially for clinically stable cases who nevertheless had to face a lengthy wait and exposure to a highly medicalised setting. Many suspected cases of COVID-19 had mild symptoms and did not require hospital assessment or admission. Patients were triaged by their GP service, and a specialist in Infectious Diseases or Public Health reviewed referrals. Community sampling enabled the ambulance service to have more capacity to respond to clinical urgent cases, and ensured inpatient beds were available for those in need.",

It met the target time period between presentation and sampling set by the Scottish Government. It avoided significant expense of unnecessary admissions. Most importantly, it was successful in avoiding a large number of resource intensive hospital admissions for testing for SARS-CoV-2 that could have put the healthcare system at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Community sampling is an intrinsic part of the response to COVID-19 and can be carried out safely, efficiently and effectively. However, after further widening of the suspected cases definition, which accounted for an increase of geographical areas presenting risk for potential exposure abroad by HPS and PHE [5] , the Lothian team witnessed a surge of referrals. Indeed, following the case definition widening on 25 February 2020, 49 suspected cases were referred for sampling in 48 hours, compared with 79 over the 14-day period in this study (6-20 February 2020). To meet this increased demand, we adapted our model to a fixed site, or 'drive through'. This commenced on 28 February [13] . Local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland and the UK nevertheless started with as at 19 March 2,644 confirmed cases in UK [14] . One possible reason may have been the mild course of COVID-19 in a relatively large proportion of those infected [15] , so that such people unknowingly contributed to ongoing transmission. Facing the larger local spread of disease, the UK moved from applying containment to delay and mitigation measures [16] . Moreover, due to capacity reasons, testing could no longer be offered to people with minor symptoms from 12 March onwards [17] . All this may have affected the approach to community testing. Measures to increase testing capacity are nevertheless currently being taken [18] . Healthcare services, and the UK and Scottish Governments, must recognise the importance of maintaining isolation of suspected cases and avoiding unnecessary contact with healthcare settings, and direct resource into facilitating community testing as far as possible. Healthcare staff should have ongoing training in these areas, including PPE use, fit testing and community experience, in order to ensure staffing resilience in response to a HCID.",
