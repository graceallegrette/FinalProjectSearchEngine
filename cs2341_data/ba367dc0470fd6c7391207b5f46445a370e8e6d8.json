Lower levels of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and procalcitonin (PCT), specifically PCT <0.25 \u03bcg/L, were statistically associated with Mp infection. A combination of age >5 years (AUC = 0.77), prodromal fever and respiratory symptoms >6 days (AUC = 0.79), and PCT <0.25 \u03bcg/L (AUC = 0.81) improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.90) (P = .05).",

There are substantial challenges in differentiating infection from carriage for Mp [3, 4] . Current diagnostic tests, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens or serology, do not reliably differentiate between Mp infection and carriage [4] . Therefore it is not surprising that previous studies found no signs or symptoms to differentiate Mp infection in CAP from other etiology [5, 6] , potentially because Mp detection was misclassified as infection when in fact it was carriage. Mp carriage is estimated to occur in up to 56% of healthy children [4, 5] . Mp infection is generally mild and self-limiting, and patients with Mp CAP are mostly managed in primary care [7] . The lack of a cell wall makes Mp naturally resistant to first-line empirical \u03b2-lactam antibiotics for CAP [5] . Empirical macrolide treatment is extensively used to cover potential Mp infection, which has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant Mp and a parallel rise in macrolide resistance in other respiratory pathogens [8] . Therefore, with the challenges in diagnostic testing for Mp and its limited use in the primary care setting, it is essential to determine clinical features and biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of Mp infection in children with CAP.",

Two or more pathogens were found in the URT of 20 (69%) Mp-positive and 13 (38%) Mp-negative patients (Table 3) . Sp was equally detected in both cohorts in >60%. Exclusively found in Mp-negative patients was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 8 [24%]; P < .01), influenza virus (n = 2), parainfluenza virus (n = 2), and coronavirus (n = 1). No virus was statistically associated with Mp positivity. Rhinovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus were equally detected in both cohorts. Thus, we also compared clinical features and biomarkers of Mp-positive patients against the following subgroups of Mpnegative patients (n = 34): first, positive for RSV (n = 8, as it is the only virus for which detection in the URT has a high predictive value for CAP etiology [16] ); second, positive for other Abbreviations: ANC, absolute neutrophil count; CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; CI, confidence interval; CRP, C-reactive protein; IQR, interquartile range; Mp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae; NA, not available; OR, odds ratio; PCT, procalcitonin; WBC, white blood cell. a Age-specific reference values for hematology were defined as previously described [46] . b According to the admission CRP/PCT ratio for risk of Mp infection in hospitalized adults with CAP by Neeser et al [24] .",

However, previous studies found no reliable signs or symptoms to differentiate Mp infection in CAP from other etiology [5, 6] , potentially because Mp infection was misclassified as infection when it was carriage. We recently demonstrated that the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay differentiates Mp infection from carriage [9] : While Mp DNA and/or IgM were also detected in 48% and 29% healthy control children (n = 21), all were tested negative by the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay [9] . Notably, the high Mp detection rate in CAP patients (46%) in this study may be related to the inclusion age of 3-18 years, in which Mp is most frequently detected [1, 2] , and the coinciding Mp epidemic in Europe during the study period [25] [26] [27] [28] . Prevalence estimates are important for translation of diagnostic study findings into clinical practice. When taking the Bayes theorem into account, the posttest probability of disease presence will be higher given a higher pretest probability or prevalence [29] [30] [31] . For proper implementation of a new diagnostic test into clinical practice, it is therefore necessary that the test will be assessed in the context of all the other diagnostic information that is available at the time point of testing.",

In our study, one-third of Mp-positive CAP patients were not treated with an antibiotic in vitro active against Mp, but all of these children fully recovered. The BTS guidelines advise that macrolide antibiotics may be added at any age in case of very severe disease or if there is no response to first-line empirical treatment [2] . Prior antibiotic treatment was associated with Mp CAP and included treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in most cases. This supports that in patients that do not respond to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, Mp CAP should be considered [2, 7] . We did not find statistical differences in fever duration following CAP diagnosis, hospital length of stay, or recovery at follow-up between Mp-positive patients who did and did not receive antibiotics against Mp (data not shown). These findings support the need for future interventional studies assessing the effect of antibiotics for Mp CAP [1, 9, 37, 38] .",

Similar trends have been observed in previous CAP studies for CRP, WBC count, and ANC [23, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , and recently for PCT with median levels from 0.05 to 0.19 \u03bcg/L in CAP considered to be caused by Mp [39] [40] [41] 44] . A study with conflicting results suggesting higher PCT levels associated with Mp may be hampered by diagnostics [45] . A PCT cutoff of <0.25 \u03bcg/L reached the best discriminatory power in differentiating Mp-positive from Mp-negative children with CAP, which is supported by previous studies [39] [40] [41] 44] . Only 1 Mp-positive patient had a PCT level of 0.55 \u03bcg/L and was above this cutoff. Our study has several limitations. First, though sampling was performed in a relevant population of clinical CAP [9] , the study population is small and represents a convenience sample from an observational study, and we cannot rule out that unintended selection occurred. However, even though the sample size is small for prediction, the scope of this study was to describe risk factors for Mp infection. Second, mild cases may not have been referred to our tertiary center. Third, the study enrolled children from 3 to 18 years of age to reduce the probability of viral infection [9] . However, younger children with Mp infection may have, more likely, other RTIs than CAP [43] .",

Biomarkers showed some differences between Mp-positive and Mp-negative patients in that Mp positivity was associated with low levels of CRP, WBC count, ANC, and PCT, particularly a PCT cutoff of <0.25 \u03bcg/L. However, the study size is small and even the best combinations of clinical features and biomarkers may not be reliable enough to be used as a diagnostic itself. Our data support that a combination of clinical features and biomarkers may help physicians in identifying patients at high risk for Mp CAP, which warrants further investigations in a larger cohort of children with Mp infection.",
