These patients presented with a constellation of symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and radiological findings showed bilateral lung glassy opacities. Furthermore, the public health office traced all these 27 cases to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which trades live species of bats, snakes, pangolins, and badgers [1] . Multiple intrinsic variables led to rapid early transmission dynamics, and this made Wuhan the flashpoint of the pandemic. In 2018, Wuhan had a documented population of 11.08 million, this made Wuhan one of the top five most populated cities in China [2] . Wuhan's large population density and proximity of the marketplace that sold live animals made it the epicenter for the human-animal interface. Additionally, the lack of early containment due to the inability to accurately trace the history of exposure in the early patient cases contributed to the rapid rate of spread in Wuhan. This eventually precipitated into the WHO declaring this viral pneumonia as an outbreak on 30th January 2020. On 11th March 2020, due to the global logarithmic expansion of the cases the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the WHO.",

The WHO renamed it to SARS-CoV-2 to destigmatize the association of the virus with any geographic location or nationality and relate it to the disease symptomatology. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is genetically similar to the SARS Coronavirus of 2002 (SARS-CoV-1). There are a myriad of other coronaviruses that cause the common cold. These coronaviruses can become infective when they attain an animal reservoir that provides an adequate cellular environment wherein the virus can multiply and acquire a series of advantageous genetic mutations. These mutations can then enable the virus to cross-species and infect and multiply within human hosts effectively.",

The genomic RNA is 30 Kb, one vital encoded structural protein is the Spike Glycoprotein (S) that consists of three S1-S2 heterodimers that bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on type II pneumocyte [3, 4] . The other surface protein such as the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) dimer is shown in Figure 1 . The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the type II pneumocyte is via endocytosis and then multiplies in the cytoplasm. The high protein manufacturing stress induced upon the type II pneumocytes leads to apoptosis. Additionally, the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and will be recognized by the pattern recognition receptor or toll-like receptors. This leads to a chemokine surge which causes neutrophil migration and activation. This leads to the destruction of the alveolar-capillary walls. At a microscopic level, this leads to a loss in the interface between the intra-alveolar space and the surrounding stroma. Therefore, fluid leaks through and fills into the alveolar sacs. ",

Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome aligned with the genomes of viruses (Bat-CoV and Bat-CoV RaTG13) in Rhinolophus affinis species of Yunnan province with 96% similarity [6] . As seen previously in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses that undertake residence in the intermediate hosts shown in Figure 2 , it was suspected that in SARS-CoV-2 pangolins were the natural reservoir. This was based on the analysis of the genome contig alignment of SARS-CoV-2 like CoV (Renamed: Pangolin-CoV) harbored in the lung tissue of two dead Malayan pangolins [7] . This Pangolin-CoV's whole genome had 91.02% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 and 90.55% similarity with Bat-CoV RaTG13 [8] . Proteomic analysis revealed that the S1 subunit of Spike glycoprotein (S) was more closely related to that of SARS-CoV-2 compared to BaT-CoV RaTG13. Furthermore, five amino acid residues of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacting with the ACE2 receptor are identical in Pangolin-CoV [8] . Contrastingly, only four amino acid residues are identical in the S protein of BaT-CoV RaTG13. Interestingly, both Pangolin-CoV and BaT-CoV RaTG13 have lost the furin recognition motif, vital to the S1/S2 cleavage [8] . This putative furin recognition sequence is still intact within the SARS-CoV-2. A compilation of all these findings portrays that pangolins are the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. ",

            "text": "The phylogenetic analysis by Tang et al. of 103 genomes with SARS-CoV-2 indicated that the two major lineages co-exist. These lineages are designated as L-type (T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine) and S-type (C28,144 is in the codon of Serine) and these are defined by the significant linkage (r2 = 0.954, and LOD = 50.13) of their SNPs at positions 8782 (orf1ab: T8517C, synonymous) and 28144 (ORF8: C251T, S84L) [9] . Furthermore, the S-type (28.7%, n = 29 out of 101) is indicated as the ancestral strain which attained a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that led to the formation of the L-type (71.9%, n = 72 out of 101). The resultant amino acids from the SNPs in the open reading frame (ORF8) have an undefined functional role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and virulence. Therefore, Tang et al.'s initial labeling of the L-type as the aggressive lineage based on its higher frequency was misleading. This aggressive lineage label has now been removed in their current addendum and the L-type is only defined as having a higher frequency. It must be noted that the 30% and 70% frequencies of the S-type and L-type correspond to patients in Wuhan. Moreover, although the S-type is ancestral lineage it was surprising that the majority of the early cases in Wuhan were of the L-type lineage and globally the S-type is more prominent. One patient (USA_2020/01/21.a, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_404253) in the USA tested positive for coinfection with S-type and L-type SARS-CoV-2, but it is unclear if this will cause any significant clinical severity due to the coinfection. It is also notable that there is no current evidence indicating that immunity against one of the lineages will provide cross-reactivity against the other lineage. This implies that a patient recovering from one COVID-19 lineage can sustain another separate COVID-19 infection from the other strain. Therefore, future vaccines must target a conserved region in both lineages. Alternatively, a separate vaccine for each lineage must be designed.",

The virion is stabilized at lower temperatures, i.e., 4\u00b0C has higher survival than 22\u00b0C [12, 13] .

Additional considerations must be made regarding the residence time of the SARS-CoV-2 virion on surfaces. The half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic are 1.5 h, 1 h, 3.4 h, 5.6 h, and 6.8 h, respectively.

These two complications are the major contributors to intensive care unit (ICU) care and mortality from COVID-19 in patients older than 60 years, with smoking history, and comorbid medical conditions. Smoking and older age group patients tend to have a higher density of ACE2 receptors. A list of chronic medical conditions affecting the clinical course of COVID-19 is summarized in Table 2 . Our overall analysis (N = 1458) showed that the leading comorbid conditions include hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes. In the largest study (n = 1099), the median age of the patients with COVID-19 is 47 years [20] . The presentation of COVID-19 is predominantly mild and asymptomatic in the age group <14. There is no explanation for this phenomenon yet. Perhaps the ACE2 receptor is not highly expressed in this age group. A preliminary unpublished single-cell transcriptomics study suggested that Asian cell donors have higher ACE2 receptor density than Caucasian and African American donors. This variance in distribution could explain the higher susceptibility of the Asian population to the SARS-nCoV-2 virus.",

This enabled countries to develop primers against the SARS-CoV-2 genome and utilize reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to make a diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, RT-PCR has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but it is only 66-80% sensitive [33] . Essentially, this means that 20-34% of patients with COVID-19 out of 100 would test negative despite being infected. This variance in the sensitivity can be attributed to the patients being tested early in the disease course wherein the viral load is beneath detection level or due to lack of automation in sample preparation for RT-PCR. Furthermore, a single negative RT-PCR does not rule out COVID-19, hence a repeat RT-PCR must be performed. The concern rises regarding the timeframe of the repeat RT-PCR, the ideal window lies between 24 to 72 hours of the negative test.",

This finding was also consistent in a case series of 51 COVID-19 patients wherein the sensitivity of CT was 98% and RT-PCR was 71% (p < 0.001) for patients investigated with imaging and assay within three days of admission [33] . The utilization of the CT scan would prevent an infected patient from being discharged back to the community. The cons of increased CT usage are the huge economic burden on the healthcare resources and the potential to contaminate the CT scanners. In the management algorithm, CT radiology can be used to stratify patients into those that require further investigation and isolation. Utilization of radiology can be directive for management plans in hospitals with ease of accessibility to CT radiology and lack of access to laboratory services or in countries that utilize a centralized laboratory service with large turnaround time.",

The most primary symptoms managed in COVID-19 are fever and non-productive cough, therefore the first-line antipyretic agent is Paracetamol and antitussive of choice is guaifenesin [21] . Supplementary oxygen at 5 L/min must be administered for patients that require management of severe respiratory distress and the oxygen saturation (SaO2) target must be \u226592-95% in pregnant patients and \u226590% in all other patients [34] . Complications such as septic shock and AKI should be managed with sepsis protocol and renal replacement therapy (RRT) respectively. Renal function tests and fluid balance measurements will enable the identification of patients indicated for RRT [21] . Some patients may develop superimposed bacterial or fungal infection in the middle to later course of COVID-19, as such appropriate empiric antimicrobial coverage must be provided. The latest version (6th edition) of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China has recommended a combination regimen of protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) with INF-\u03b1. The rationale for this combination treatment is based on experience with this regimen in reducing the mortality rates in SARS. The WHO recommends usage of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients that sustain hypoxia refractory to supplementary oxygen [31] . Alternatively, convalescent plasma and IgG are used as rescue therapy in critical cases but there is no robust evidence for this practice.",

HDIVC has been implicated in reducing plasma cell-free DNA formed from the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) which is the facilitator of systemic inflammation in sepsis-induced multi-organ failure [38, 39] . Interestingly, elevated levels of syndecan-1 in the plasma correlate with increased mortality in severe sepsis and ARDS, and this endothelial glycocalyx can be reduced significantly by HDIVC [39] . As of 14 February 2020, there is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) undertaken at the Zhongnan Hospital (NCT04264533) that aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C in viral pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2. They hypothesize that vitamin C infusion can improve the prognosis of severe acute respiratory tract infections.

The functional role of the ACE2 receptor has a reciprocal physiological action to ACE1, it converts the angiotensin II back into angiotensin I. Therefore, patients taking ARBs will have an increased plasma level of angiotensin II. Contrastingly, patients taking ACEi will have low levels of angiotensin II. There is an upregulation of ACE2 receptors in the kidney and heart in response to ACEi or ARB dosing in rats and humans [46] [47] [48] . There is no data available on its effect in the alveolar tissue. If there is a similar upregulation of ACE2 receptors then there will be heightened infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 along with subsequent clinical illness severity. Discontinuation of ACEi or ARBs is not recommended yet as hypertension is an acute risk of discontinuation and can exacerbate the clinical course and increase mortality of COVID-19 if infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Due to the lack of available and validated therapeutics, most of the countermeasures rely on the usage of public health containment and quarantine approaches. Primary learning points from this COVID-19 pandemic are to upheld transparency to prevent delays in threat identification. Secondly, delays in travel restriction and self-quarantine measures led to a logarithmic expansion of cases. Lastly, there is a need to increase investments towards research and development in COVID-19.",
