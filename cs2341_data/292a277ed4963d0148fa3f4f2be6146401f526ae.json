Thus, there are more people affected at a lower age 207 in India when compared to China. This observation can be explained by the population 208 distribution of India. In previous studies on COVID 19, it has been established that the risk 209 increases with age and comorbidities (13, 23, 24). However, according to the population 210 demographics in India for 2020 (36), the broad based nature of India's population pyramid 211 means there are more people in the younger age group category and very few people in the above 212 80 years age group category.This is reflected in the number of cases which are more in the 213 younger age groups. On normalizing the percentage of patients in each age group with the 214 corresponding percentage representation of the population, we observed that the highest number 215 of male patients is in the 20-39 years age group category. Interestingly, according to this 216",

All over China, the Rt varied from 259 1.23 to 5.77. South Korea which has high population density like India had a decreasing trend of 260 Rt from 9.72 on 20 February to 1.50 on 7 March. This indicates that the interventions have been 261 helpful in preventing the worst case scenario in India but is unable to prevent the spike in 262 number of cases (33,34).The situation can still be controlled if Rt can be brought down close to 263 1.This indicates the need for severe interventions required and ensuring optimum testing to avoid 264 underestimation of danger. 265 The impact of the COVID-19 response ( overall quarantine regulations , social distancing, and 266 isolation of infections) in China in this context is encouraging for the many other countries (35) 267 where the Rt gradually stabilized for most provinces ranging between 0.96 to 1.57 where there 268 were more than 100 cases (32), and India should try and replicate this when community 269 transmission starts by strict enforcement of lockdown measures to get the Rt closer to 1,so that 270 COVID would not overwhelm the Indian healthcare system. The Indian government will not be viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for 273 individuals; hence the Indian government must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable 274 economic downturn (36). However the Indian government's timely decision to put a country 275 wide lockdown into place when the number of cases was documented to be only 415,and 276 effective contact tracing definitely helped to reduce the Rt and prevent an Italy/US like situation 277 (however in the context of violations of the lockdown, more data awaited).278LIMITATIONS279The lack of enough kits for testing at the beginning of the outbreak among other logistic and 280 political reasons was one of the major issues. The Indian government tried to correct these issues281 by altering the criteria for testing on 21 March 2020. However, it undermines the quality of data 282 collected in the early phase of the epidemic. We have used crowd sourced data from 283 covid19india.org due to lack of availability of official data. Even though the number of cases in 284 India till 28 March was more, we could not include all the cases due to unavailability of the 285 demographic details of all the patients. If these details along with the clinical details as well are 286 released, further studies can help in better assessment of the disease course. Also, it could help 287 the government with better interventions to control the spread of the disease.",
