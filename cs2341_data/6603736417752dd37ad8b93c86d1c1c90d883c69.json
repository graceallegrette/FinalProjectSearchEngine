The assay has high specificity, but low sensitivity. Hence, chest CT has become a critical diagnostic tool for COVID-19, used in close combination with clinical manifestations and epidemiological evidence for disease confirmation. However, discrepancies between the results of NAT and imaging features have been reported in the literature. For example, the CT images of some patients showed apparent lesions in the lungs, yet NAT repeatedly showed negative results until eventually turning positive [4] . Recently, Fang et al. observed that in diagnosing COVID-19, the sensitivity of CT (98%) was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR (71%) [5] . China's Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia (5th Trial Edition) has established CT imaging as the clinical diagnosis in Hubei Province. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further studies to provide data and evidence on the manifestations of COVID-19 in chest CT imaging.",

In this study, we had marginally more female subjects than male subjects, which could be related to the fact that the average age of men was lower than that of women. The major clinical symptoms observed included fever (65%), cough (65%), consistent with previous reports [3] . Notably, 76% of the patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan. Although the contact history of the other 24% was unclear, these patients worked in crowded environments where numerous people gathered (such as restaurants and hotels). In this group of patients, the WBC and neutrophil counts and the procalcitonin levels were normal in most cases, but the CRP was elevated, consistent with the report by Chen et al. [8] . Lymphocyte count was decreased in 74 patients (57%), and the average age were 51 \u00b1 16 years; 57 patients (43%) presented normal lymphocyte counts, and the average age were 42 \u00b1 11 years(P = 0.002).

            "text": "Initial chest CT scan failed to reveal any lesions in 6 of the 131 patients, while the CT findings of the remaining 125 cases showed that the majority of lesions (79%) involved bilateral lungs, 88% of the lesions involved two or more lobes simultaneously, and nearly 76% of the lesions were distributed in the periphery of the lung. The lesions were not confined to certain segments of lung lobes, possibly due to the small size of the virions that tend to deposit on the lobules in the periphery of the lung, thereby causing damage to the alveolar epithelium and affecting multiple adjacent lobules [10] . Common chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 included: (1) patchy ground-glass opacities with clear margins and visible interlobular septal thickening inside the lesions were observed in 106 cases (81%), some cases appeared a typical \" crazy paving pattern\", and visible vascular thickening. This can be explained by the virusinduced diffuse alveolar wall injury, vascular congestion, and alveolar septal inflammation [11] . (2) Increased lesion density, along with disease progression manifested as patchy consolidations, was detected in 91 cases (69%). These pathological changes could be attributed to alveolar wall collapse, causing the replacement of alveoli by exudates or products of other diseases (such as cells and epithelium) [12] . Recently, the autopsy of the first COVID-19 patient who died in China revealed significant shedding of the alveolar epithelium and the formation of the pulmonary hyaline membrane [13] , consistent with the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, i.e. cough without substantial sputum. (3) Mixed lesions of ground-glass opacities and consolidations was observed in 79 patients (61%), with or without nodule. Diffused, bilateral pulmonary lesions similar to \"white lungs\" was observed in Table 3 The follow-up results of chest CT in 91 patients *The first chest CT examination was negative 10 patients. In these cases, consolidations constituted most of the lesions, with a small percentage demonstrating complicated pulmonary fibrotic foci, which might be related to the fact that the lesions were in the repairing phase [14] . Uncommon chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 included: (1) nodular lesions in 40 patients (31%). Only 7 of them had simple nodular lesions, whereas the rest had mixed nodular lesions with either ground-glass opacities or consolidations, and the other two signs are the main manifestations. (2) CT showing low central but high peripheral lesion density, or the so-called \"reversed halo sign\", in the first CT scan of 1 patient. In another patient, the first CT scan showed nodular lesions, but the \"reversed halo sign\" emerged in the follow-up CT scan 2 days after. The pathological mechanism remains unknown, but this is not a specific imaging characteristic of COVID-19. Other diseases such as organizing pneumonia, cryptococcosis, and tuberculosis can also present the \"reversed halo sign\" with different pathological mechanisms [15] . (3) A small number of cases showed thickening of adjacent pleura, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, consistent with previous reports [16] . (4) In 1 case, a consolidation with cavity, it might be related to the bronchial discharge of necrotic material of the lesion. This was an extremely rare phenomenon.",

COVID-19 is highly suspected if the patient also has reduced lymphocytes along with epidemiological evidence. Furthermore, it should be noted that some patients with normal chest CT imaging could demonstrate a positive NAT result.",
