To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241-and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.",

The seven CoVs that can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the \u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2coronaviruses lineage A, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage B (\u03b2-B coronaviruses), and MERS-CoV in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage C. 6 To develop specific SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 89.8% sequence identity in their spike (S) proteins S2 subunits, which mediate the membrane fusion process, and both of their S1 subunits utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells. 6 Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-to 20fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, 12 which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV.",

By intranasal application of this peptide, either preor post-challenge with coronavirus, the treated mice were protected from HCoV-OC43 or MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide has prophylactic and therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 14 Indeed, our recent studies have shown that EK1 peptide is effective against SARS-CoV-2 S proteinmediated membrane fusion and PsV infection in a dosedependent manner. 15 In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus fusion inhibitors. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core and identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its enhanced interactions with HR2 domain.

Indeed, in live SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c) . To further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP (293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing human ACE2 receptor as the target cells ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary information, Fig. S1a ). After effector cells and target cells were cocultured at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h, hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple nuclei (Fig. 1d) . Another 24 h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily observed under both light and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1e) . Similar results were observed in the fusion between 293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells, which naturally express human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Their syncytium was obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed by live SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c, f) . On the contrary, SARS-CoV S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell-cell fusion under the same conditions ( Fig. 1d ) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membrane fusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry into target cells. 14 Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells without S-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary information, Fig. S1b ), confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusion and entry.",

This significant difference has not been observed in other SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367, and RsSHC014. As shown in Fig. 3b , the K911 in SARS-CoV HR1 could bind to E1176 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.9 \u00c5 in distance. However, with the Lys-Ser replacement, S929 in SARS-CoV-2 binds to S1196 through a strong hydrogen bond 2.4 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV, Q915 in the HR1 domain does not bind to the HR2 domain. However, with Q-K replacement in the new virus, K933 in the HR1 domain binds to carbonyl oxygen of N1172 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3b) . In SARS-CoV, E918 in the HR1 domain binds to R1166 in the HR2 domain through a weak salt bridge 3.7 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated to D936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3c) . In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge 3.2 \u00c5 in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925 was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogen bond 2.6 \u00c5 in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3d) . These results suggested that the multiple replacements in the HR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions between HR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead to increased infectivity of the virus.",

Recently, numerous reports have shown that the lipidation strategy can effectively improve the antiviral activity of fusion inhibitory peptides, such as the ant-HIV-1 peptide LP-19, 18 and the anti-Nipah virus lipopeptides. 19 In order to improve the inhibitory activity of EK1, cholesterol (Chol) and palmitic acid (Palm) were covalently attached to the Cterminus of EK1 sequence under the help of a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, and the corresponding lipopeptides EK1C and EK1P were constructed, respectively (Fig. 4a) . Both of them could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion at the concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4b) . The inhibitory activity with mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values is 48.1 nM for EK1C and 69.2 nM for EK1P, respectively (Fig. 4c) . Meanwhile, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity with the concentration up to 5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4c) . These results strongly suggest that lipidation of EK1 is a promising strategy to improve its fusion-inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially, cholesterol-modification.",

Compared with EK1C1, EK1C2 and EK1C showed similar inhibitory activities. Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker \"GSG\" and the PEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. It is noteworthy that changing \"GSG\" in EK1C3 to a longer 5-amino acid linker \"GSGSG\" significantly increased the inhibitory potency of the hybrid molecule, and EK1C4 had IC 50 value of 1.3 nM, which was 43-fold more potent than EK1C1. These findings indicate that the linker length has a significant effect on the overall activity of lipopeptides. Comparison of increasing PEGbased arm lengths in EK1C4 shows that inhibitors potency slightly decreased in the cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4e) . The data suggest that \"GSGSG-PEG4\" linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates. Similarly, EK1C4 showed the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection, with IC 50 value of 15.8 nM, providing 149-fold stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than that of EK1 (IC 50 = 2,375 nM) (Fig. 4f) .",

Among them, SARS-CoV has the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, and its S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion could be effectively inhibited by EK1C4 with IC 50 of 4.3 nM, which is about 94-fold more active than that of EK1 (IC 50 = 409.3 nM) (Fig. 5a) . Similarly, EK1C4 showed extremely potent fusioninhibitory activity on MERS-S-and OC43-S-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC 50 of 2.5 nM and 7.7 nM, which were 95-and 101-fold more potent when compared to EK1, respectively, indicating that EK1C4 could potently and broadly inhibit S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion of various \u03b2-HCoVs (Fig. 5b, c) . For \u03b1-HCoVs, EK1C4 also effectively blocked the fusion process mediated by the S protein of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 with IC 50 of 5.2 nM and 21.4 nM, respectively, while EK1 showed inhibitory activity of IC 50 ranging from 207.4 to 751.0 nM (Fig. 5d, e) . Moreover, with their potential for human infection, SL-CoVs, including WIV1, Rs3367 and RsSHC014, the fusion process of which is mediated by S protein, could also be significantly prevented by EK1C4 with IC 50 ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 nM, as well as EK1 with IC 50 ranging from 237.0 to 279.6 nM ( Fig. 5f-h) . As control, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity with concentration up to 5 \u03bcM in all those coronavirus cell-cell fusion assays (Fig. 5a-h) .",

Importantly, EK1C4 effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the cellular level in a dosedependent manner with IC 50 of 36.5 nM, being 67-fold more active than that of EK1 (IC 50 = 2,468 nM) (Fig. 6a) , which is consistent to the results of cell-cell fusion assay and PsV infection assay mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

We next assessed the cytotoxicity of EK1C4 on various target cells and found that the half cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was beyond 5 \u03bcM, which is the highest detection concentration of EK1C4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3) . Therefore, the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /IC 50 ) of EK1C4 is >136, suggesting that EK1C4 is a promising SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor with little, or even no, toxic effect in vitro. Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 and found that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, and EK1C4/SARS-2-HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of the complexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Supplementary information,  Fig. S4 ). These results suggested that increased antiviral activity of EK1C4 should be related to its increased binding affinity with HR1, but their detailed interactions require further studies.",

Here, we used an HCoV-OC43 infection mouse model to further investigate the potential prophylactic effect of EK1C4 in clinical applications via the intranasal administration route (Fig. 6f, g) . In the OC43-infected mouse model, we treated newborn mice with EK1C4 at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg 0.5 h (Pre-0.5), 2 h (Pre-2), 4 h (Pre-4), 12 (Pre-12) and 24 h (Pre-24) before challenging with HCoV-OC43 at 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). Starting from 4 days' post-infection (dpi), the body weight of mice in the viral control group decreased significantly along with 100% mortality (Fig. 6f,  g) . The final survival rates of mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12 and Pre-24 groups were 100%, 100%, 100%, 83 and 0%, respectively (Fig. 6f, g) . In contrast, EK1 with a single dose of 20 mg/kg via nasal administration exhibited very promising prophylactic effect in the Pre-0.5 h and Pre-1 h groups, whereas all mice in the EK1-Pre-2 h group eventually died similarly to the mice in the viral control group (Supplementary information, Fig. S5 ).

            "text": "Unlike SARS-CoV, live SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were found to form typical syncytium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may mainly utilize the plasma membrane fusion pathway to enter and replicate inside host cells. Consistently, in the cell-cell fusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation of syncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenous proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not. Actually, the plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host cell antiviral immunity. 23, 24 Generally, \u03b2-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. For example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated. 25 Inducing the S1/S2 furinrecognition site could significantly increase the capacity of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection. 26 Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored (Supplementary information, Fig. S7) . A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell. 27 The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the most important targets for drug design. In previous studies, we have found that HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed conformations remain unknown. According to the Xray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b) , it is a typical 6-HB fusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although the amino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fully identical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2. However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing ones in other regions (Fig. 3) . When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distance of 2.4 \u00c5. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance of 2.7 \u00c5, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction. In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2 domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral infectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinity between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. 12 The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1. 28 However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol group in the Cterminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear. There is a possibility that the cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of inhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity between EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone, which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly (Supplementary information, Fig. S4 ). Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Supplementary information, Fig. S8 ). In this model, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove of HR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety. The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind to HR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may form between HR1 and helical region of EK1C4. The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linker of EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two binding targets. Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studies in the future.",

            "text": "In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an important target for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors. In the early outbreak of MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection. 16 The results from animal experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung more than 1000-fold. 29 However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity against other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well prepared for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we designed and synthesized the first pancoronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel \u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2. 15 We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving its fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs. EK1C4 showed prolonged and significant prophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting that EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Consistent with other studies, 30 HCoV-OC43 was shown as a typical neurotropic virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal administration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe pathological changes in human lung tissue. 4 Therefore, EK1C4 administered intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. 31 Their in vivo efficacies still require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drugresistant mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified, 32 but we found that both HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show 100% identity (Supplementary information, Fig. S9 ), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs. Cell-cell fusion assay The establishment and detection of several cell-cell fusion assays are as previously described. 14, 16 In brief, Huh-7 cells (for testing all coronaviruses) or 293T/ACE2 cells (for testing SARS-CoV-2) were used as target cells. For preparing effector cells expressing S protein a coronavirus, 293T cells were transfected with one of the S protein expression vectors, including 293T/SARS-CoV-2/GFP, 293T/MERS-CoV/GFP, 293T/HCoV-229E/GFP, 293T/SARS-CoV/GFP, or 293T/SL-CoV/GFP, 293T/HCoV-OC43/GFP, 293T/HCoV-NL63/GFP or empty plasmid pAAV-IRES-EGFP. For SARS-CoV S-, SL-CoV S-, OC43 S-or NL63 S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays, effector cells and target cells were cocultured in DMEM containing trypsin (80 ng/mL) for 4 h, while for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays, effector cells and target cells were cocultured in DMEM without trypsin but 10% FBS for 2 h. After incubation, five fields were randomly selected in each well to count the number of fused and unfused cells under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S).",

The resulting sequences encoding the fused HR1-L6-HR2 protein were then cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing a His 6 -SUMO tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. The recombinant construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin at 37\u00b0C and were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 12 h at 16\u00b0C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and were lysed by high-pressure homogenizer twice after resuspension in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mM NaCl. The fusion proteins were isolated by Niaffinity chromatography, and the SUMO tag was removed by Ulp1 enzyme (1:100 w/w) cleavage. HR1-L6-HR2 protein was concentrated and gel-filtered on a 10/300 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column. Peak fractions containing HR1-L6-HR2 trimer were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml through centrifugation (EMD Millipore).",

Human hepatoma Huh-7 cells were from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), and 293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 (293T/ACE2) cells were kindly provided by L.D. All of these cell lines were maintained and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco). Patient-derived COVID-19 (BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) was isolated by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. 6 MERS-CoV-EMC/2012 was originally provided by Chuan Qin (Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases). ATCC strain of Human coronavirus 229E (VR-740), as well as Human coronavirus OC43 (VR-1558) and HCoV-NL63 (Amsterdam strain) strains were amplified in Huh-7, HCT-8 and LLC-MK2 cells, respectively.
