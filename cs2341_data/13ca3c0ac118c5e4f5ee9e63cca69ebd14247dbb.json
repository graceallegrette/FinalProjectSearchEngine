Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity.",

Legal and ethical matters have been a principal consideration for pandemic planning, domestically and internationally [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Of specific concern are public health measures that could adversely affect trade, travel, and economic stability; tip the balance between personal liberty and public wellbeing; or strain people's sense of justice or fairness [4, 5] . Among the legal and ethical issues and dilemmas that the World Health Organization (WHO) first outlined for member states' consideration when undertaking pandemic preparedness planning are state of emergency declarations, movement restrictions, mass gathering prohibitions, school closures, isolation and quarantine, volunteer licensing and liability, drug and vaccine manufacturer liability, research participant protections, compulsory vaccination, and resource rationing [6] .",

What proportions of an antiviral stockpile to commit to treatment and prophylaxis, as well as who to prioritize constitute another dilemma [12] . Likewise, the projected number of US patients requiring an intensive care unit (ICU) bed and mechanical ventilation during a 1918-like pandemic eclipses current capacity by orders of magnitude [13] . In other contexts (eg, African countries with weak economies and endemic malaria and HIV/AIDS), a higher order predicament exists: whether to prioritize a response to a pandemic flu or to hyperendemic diseases [6, 14] .",

Pandemic ethicists invoke principles such as transparency, inclusivity, and education and information, citing multiple benefits. Authorities are enjoined to: 1. Open up decisions to scrutiny and articulate clearly the rationale behind specific choices. As a result, the public can be more confident that policies are not capricious, but reasonable, equitable, and in line with community views [4, 5, 7, 9, 16, 17] . 2. Elicit community input early on, especially that of disadvantaged groups. By doing so decision makers can more readily earn public trust, enhance social solidarity, add to a policy's legitimacy, and discern which approaches are socially acceptable and practically feasible [7] [8] [9] [15] [16] [17] . 3 . Provide the public with accurate, timely, and understandable information about the pandemic threat, measures for personal protection, and collective actions for readiness and response. This can foster an educated populace-one better able to engage meaningfully with policymakers and play their own part in risk reduction [7, 15, 16] .",

Nonetheless, over the last 15 years, members of the public have had some degree of opportunity to inform potentially divisive pandemic policies in the United States (see Multimedia Appendix 1 for more details) and elsewhere [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Often convened by public health agencies, and occasionally by university researchers, private citizens and interested stakeholders have participated in dialogue and deliberation sessions about pandemic dilemmas in which ethical principles (eg, liberty, beneficence, fairness) and technical matters (eg, disease containment, medical treatment) are inextricably bound.",

The WHO ethical guidance for a pandemic highlights the need for international solidarity and shared principles, as well as a recognition that local circumstances and cultural values also influence ethical considerations [16] . In its pandemic ethical guidelines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposes balancing centralized decision making at the federal level and implementation by state and local communities, and it advises consideration toward marginalized communities and groups whose cultural, religious, and other values require sensitivity [9] . Procedural ethics-in particular, bringing affected groups to the table so that their needs and views on a shared health threat are genuinely heard, and they see a policy as having been made fairly even if they may not agree with the final decision-are identified as a key means to respect cultural differences while advancing pandemic preparedness and response [14] .",

Similarly, calls have been made for greater inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australian national, state, and territory pandemic plans so that the heightened risk of these indigenous groups can be mitigated in more culturally appropriate ways [49] [50] [51] . Planning experiences with Canada's First Nations communities and American Indian and Alaska Native communities have also evidenced the value of participatory processes in uncovering the influence of local beliefs, values, and practices upon pandemic health and in strengthening the cultural competence, social acceptance, and practical feasibility of pandemic preparedness and response efforts that affect these groups [52, 53] .",

It builds upon prior work by the authors exploring the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza [37] [38] [39] . Our initial aims were to develop, pilot, and apply a deliberative democratic procedure for conducting community forums state-wide that would inform a Maryland framework for the allocation of scarce health care resources in a disaster. An important finding was the need to convene a diverse, regionally varied sample of state residents to capture different ways of thinking about scarcity that local history and place seemed to influence [37, 38] . Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team decided to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere. We wondered if the same core values continue to hold in other areas of the United States, whether variation in ethical frames of reference exists at the US regional level, and what practical implications of sameness and difference may follow for pandemic planners and policymakers.",

Second, community members then met in groups of 4-7 where they engaged in a moderated discussion around the question: \"What should we do in situations where there are more patients needing ventilators than there are ventilators to use?\" During the discussion, participants were prompted to consider six ethical principles for prioritizing ventilator use: those most likely to survive the current illness; those most likely to live longest; those who have lived the fewest life stages; those with value to others in a pandemic; first come, first served; and a lottery. Third, at the discussion's end, each group developed 1-2 questions that they then asked to a panel of subject matter experts that included clinicians, ethicists, and disaster experts. Fourth, after this Q and A panel, and a break for lunch, moderated group discussions continued, this time focusing on the question: \"Should healthcare providers be allowed to take a ventilator away from one patient who needs it to survive and give it to another patient who also needs it to survive?\"",

About a third of participants noted never having been married, and a similar proportion said that they had children living at home. Independents and Democrats were represented in roughly equal numbers, followed by Republicans. Religious affiliation was nearly entirely Christian or Catholic. Most participants had a college education or higher, and similar numbers earned US $40,000-$100,000 or over US $100,000. It is important to note that the sample was small, consisting of only 6 discussion forums comprised of 30 total individuals. Such a sample size would be prohibitive in survey research; however, the sample size is appropriate to qualitative methods like deliberative democracy where findings are not considered to be generalizable in the traditional sense. The sample was also not representative of Central Texas as a whole; there was a bias toward an urban population and an overrepresentation of highly educated people. At the same time, diversity within the discussion groups in regard to age, education, race and ethnicity, and other factors likely mitigated some of these issues, as respondents within discussion groups spoke with and listened to one another.

Survivability was an important clinical consideration, but so too was the social consideration of a patient's familial role (eg, are they a mother). Moreover, San Antonio participants, particularly the expert group, singled out family as a key local cultural value. Authorities, they argued, who want to connect effectively with local residents and gain their trust in regard to allocation decisions, should approach families, not individuals, as the partner to engage in understanding prioritization rationale, especially in the case of a withdrawal scenario.",

Social and behavioral researchers have theorized familismo, family-centeredness, as a core cultural ideal among Mexican-origin peoples in particular and, to an extent, Hispanics more generally [59] . Features of the familismo value system include obligations among family members (nuclear and extended) to provide economic and emotional support, perceptions of kin as a reliable source of help, family as a core aspect of self-identity, and consultation and conformity with family regarding personal decisions and actions [60] . Mexican Americans tend to view life-threatening illness as a problem for the entire family and health care decisions as a collective matter, in contrast to the privileging of autonomy in Anglo-American medical ethics [61] . These sentiments were particularly present among the groups convened in San Antonio, a city in which a majority of residents claim Mexican heritage; however, family was also a recurrent theme among the study's predominantly white participants from rural Colorado County. This is likely indicative of a cultural bias within the region where the family is a central institution [62, 63] .",

Familismo has greater relevance in the southwestern United States than in northern, midwestern states where few Hispanics reside. In a state with many Mexican heritage residents and a wider regional and cultural emphasis on family, Texas health authorities may find themselves having to weigh family as a prioritization principle more heavily than peers in other US regions. Another public engagement exercise that oversampled for Spanish speakers found, for instance, that Hispanics prioritized children and pregnant women at much higher rates than non-Hispanics [31] . In addition, the varying religious compositions of US regions may shape the ethical principles that matter most to local communities in relation to allocation matters. Christianity, for instance, represents 59% of the religious composition of adults in New York City, in contrast to 77% in Texas [64] .",

If a state like Texas develops a framework to standardize allocation decisions, then community-level health authorities and clinicians could localize how it is procedurally administered and conveyed to the wider community. This could help create a more culturally competent approach to scarce resource allocation. In respecting familismo, for instance, health facilities could adopt communication strategies that strengthen cross-cultural competency among critical care staff [65] . Moreover, health facilities could establish a process that gives family members a chance to confer among themselves when the patient no longer benefits from mechanical ventilation and withdrawal is called for. The emphasis within the familismo value system upon the collective and duty to the whole also provides a salient moral frame through which local authorities could communicate effectively about the need for developing and applying an allocation framework, and the importance of taking proactive measures that would help delay the implementation of an allocation framework in the first place, such as strengthening medical surge capacity.",

Conveners of pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have similarly advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in the development of an ethical framework to guide the allocation of finite medical resources such as mechanical ventilators during a public health catastrophe (Multimedia Appendix 1). The Maryland and Central Texas comparison that reveals familismo as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value, moreover, demonstrates that public engagement efforts can ultimately enhance the cultural competence of an ethical allocation framework's development, implementation, and communication [52, 53] .",
