Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ). Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P < 0.10. Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger's test and Begg's test, and Trim and Fill analysis.",

Infections were first identified in Wuhan, China, before being detected in other Chinese cities and in more than a dozen countries around the world by early February 2020 [5] . The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO on 30 January 2020. COVID-19infected pneumonia is characterized by flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases death [6] [7] [8] . Humanto-human transmission has been confirmed for the virus [9] [10] [11] , which is considered related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the COVID-19 is a serious threat to human health [7, 12] . As of 16 March 2020, nearly 170,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the world [13] . Effective prevention and treatment are crucial in this situation.",

In 2002, traditional Chinese herbal medicine played an important role in the treatment of SARS, and 58.3% of confirmed cases received traditional Chinese herbal medicine [32] . A Cochrane Review [33] found that Chinese herbs combined with western medicine significantly improved symptoms of SARS, including decreasing body temperature, cough and breathing difficulties, dosages of corticosteroids, improving absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and quality of life. A review [34] of 90 studies of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for SARS revealed positive but inconclusive results about the efficacy of combined treatment, using traditional Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant. Based on previous experience of treating SARS with traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the General Office of the National Health and Health Commission of China and the Office of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine encouraged the integration of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and western medicine. Different prescriptions are recommended in different stages of disease. This is the first systematic review to examine empirical evidence of the application of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19 pneumonia. It will provide an overview of the application of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating COVID-19 patients and assess the strengths and limitations of available evidence. Furthermore, it will be guided by the PRISMA statement [25] and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 checklist [35] to achieve as high a level of quality as possible in reporting and methodology. This protocol may have the limitation that we developed it based on designs of current registered clinical trials, but we will update our proposed methods promptly on our PROSPERO record should these methods change. This review will help explore the potential role for traditional Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment or prevention of viral infections affecting the pneumonia.",
